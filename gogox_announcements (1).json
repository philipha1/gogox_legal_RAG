During the six months period ended June 30, 2023, due to the increasingly challenging market conditions faced by its Chinese mainland, Hong Kong and overseas operations. The Group did not meet its originally anticipated growth in revenue and earnings and the on-demand logistics market in Chinese mainland and Hong Kong is suffering from lower than expected post-pandemic compound annual revenue growth. Although both the Group and the market showed optimism towards the post-pandemic economic recovery in 2023, the overall economic rebound, particularly the Chinese mainland market, fell short of expectations in the first half of 2023. Additionally, the market capitalization of the technology sector, which the Group’s business situated, experienced a downward trend, indicating a decline in the perceived value of the Group’s business by market participants. The directors assess the recoverable amount of the CGU, based on a FVLCOD calculations which uses cash flow projection based on the revised financial budgets covering five financial years, with reference to the valuation performed by PG Advisory (PGA), an independent professional valuer. In response to the latest market situation, the Group underwent a strategic transformation, shifting its focus away from pursuing revenue growth through high subsidy. Recently, the Board also revised downwards its forecast for revenue growth, the cash flow projections and other valuation parameters including discount rate for logistics services and platform services in Chinese mainland, Hong Kong, and other Asian countries.

In the first half of 2023, our adjusted net loss was RMB121.3 million, up by 2.6% as compared to the corresponding period of 2022. We define adjusted net loss (a non-IFRS measure) as loss for the period adjusted for (i) share-based compensation expenses, (ii) changes in fair value of financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, (iii) listing expenses, and (iv) impairment of goodwill. In particular, we consider these non-IFRS measures as an additional analytical tool for you to assess our operating results without the effect of certain non-cash items, such as share-based compensation expenses, changes in fair value of financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss and impairment of goodwill. Further, changes in fair value of financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, listing expenses and impairment of goodwill are typically one-off and non-recurring in nature. Share-based compensation expenses consist of non-cash expenses arising from granting share options, restricted shares",

Currently, we have operations in six countries and regions in Asia, including Chinese mainland, Hong Kong, Singapore, Korea, India and Vietnam, covering more than 370 cities. We manage two highly recognized and trusted brands: Kuaigou Dache (快狗打車) in Chinese mainland and GoGoX in other Asian markets, both of which excel in the online intra-city logistics space. We offer a diverse portfolio of platform services, enterprise logistics solutions, and a series of value-added services to meet the evolving needs of individual users, small businesses, and large corporate clients, ensuring that we remain at the forefront of the logistics industry.

Non-IFRS Measures To supplement this announcement, which is presented in accordance with IFRSs, we also presented the adjusted net loss and adjusted EBITDA as additional financial measures. The management believes that the presentation of adjusted net loss (a non-IFRS measure) and adjusted EBITDA (a non-IFRS measure) would facilitate comparisons of operating performance from year-on-year and comparisons with other comparable companies with similar business operations by eliminating the potential impact of certain items. We define adjusted net loss (a non-IFRS measure) as loss for the year adjusted for (i) share-based compensation expenses and (ii) impairment of goodwill. In 2024, our adjusted net loss was RMB86.1 million, down by 49.4% as compared to 2023. We define adjusted EBITDA as adjusted net loss for the year adjusted for (i) income tax credit, (ii) depreciation and amortization, and (iii) net finance income. In 2024, our adjusted EBITDA was negative RMB68.3 million, down by 51.4% as compared to 2023. – 23 –",

The acquisition of the Target Company brings several strategic advantages to the Group. The Target Company’s modular AI framework, including trained language models, multilingual natural language processing, and automation logic, can be seamlessly integrated into the Group’s digital platforms, accelerating deployment timelines and eliminating the need for system development from scratch. Additionally, the Target Company’s proprietary AI speech-to-speech agent strengthens customer-facing AI tools, particularly benefiting the Group’s logistics and customer service operations. The Target Company’s integration- ready application programming interface and cloud architecture enhance platform synergy, enabling cost savings and long-term scalability across the Group’s ecosystem. Furthermore, onboarding the Target Company’s engineering team ensures the retention of AI expertise and continuity in development. Lastly, the Target Company’s technology plays a pivotal role in advancing the Group’s global customer service centers by integrating AI-driven chatbots, voice AI, and intelligent CRM tools, significantly improving efficiency, multilingual support, and 24/7 availability. – 3 –",

    "text": "(i) to gain proprietary access to conversational AI and voice assistant intellectual property; (ii) to reduce dependence on third-party vendors, such as the current dumbChat subscription; (iii) to secure a highly capable engineering team to accelerate in-house AI development; and (iv) to customize AI tools specifically for logistics operations and support workflows. The Acquisition will directly strengthen the Group’s customer service operations, which are substantial in scope. The Group operates customer service centers across multiple markets, supported by over 60 personnel across the regions. These teams manage a high volume of repetitive tasks, including order status inquiries, onboarding support, payment questions, and customer feedback handling. By integrating the Target Company’s AI technology, the Group will be able to automate a significant share of first-line customer service interactions, both text and voice, in multiple languages. This will lead to a substantial boost in efficiency, allowing the same service volume to be handled with fewer resources or improved quality, especially during peak delivery seasons. The Group also expects to reduce overall customer service costs by relying less on headcount, accelerating issue resolution, and offering 24/7 self-service support. The Target Company’s flexible AI stack can be integrated into both driver-facing and shipper-facing interfaces, improving user experience and operational productivity. Furthermore, the AI engineering talent within the Target Company can directly support the Group in developing and deploying bespoke AI-driven applications tailored to its logistics operations, further driving automation and competitive differentiation. According to industry benchmarks, companies that adopt conversational AI typically achieve significant savings in customer service costs. For instance, Vodafone reported a substantial drop in cost per chat, while Klarna replaced the equivalent of a significant number of agents with AI-driven tools. Ultimately, the Acquisition supports the Group’s broader strategy for long-term digital transformation and margin expansion through AI-driven operational leverage within its logistics platform business. – 5 –",
