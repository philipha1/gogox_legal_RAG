    "text": "June 2025 (after trading hours) Parties (i) GGEx Holdings Limited, as the Purchaser, a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company; and (ii) Tam Chun Lam (譚峻霖), as the Vendor. To the best of the Directors’ knowledge, information and belief having made all reasonable enquiries, the Vendor is an Independent Third Party. Assets to be acquired Pursuant to the Agreement, the Purchaser has conditionally agreed to acquire and the Vendor has conditionally agreed to sell the Sale Shares, representing the entire issued share capital of the Target Company. Consideration Pursuant to the Agreement, the Consideration for the Acquisition shall be HK$11,922,600, which shall be settled by way of issue and allotment of 3,100,000 new Shares at the Issue Price to the Vendor upon Completion. – 2 – Basis of Consideration The Consideration was determined after arm’s length negotiations between the Company and the Vendor on normal commercial terms after taking into account, among others, (i) the historical financial performance of the Target Company for the year ended 31 March 2025; (ii) the financial position of the Target Company as at 31 March 2025; and (iii) the Company’s assessment of the prospects of the Group upon the Acquisition as described in the paragraph headed “Reasons for and benefits of the Acquisition”. In addition, as part of the Company’s efforts in evaluating the fairness and reasonableness of the Consideration and the valuation of the Target Company, the Company has considered the following: Strategic and Technological Rationale The Target Company is a Hong Kong-based software company established in 2014 with specialized capabilities in artificial intelligence (“AI”) chatbot systems, customer relationship management (“CRM”) integration, and multilingual speech-to-speech agents. The Group’s primary objective in the acquisition is to gain immediate access to the Target Company’s intellectual property, proprietary software stack, and engineering expertise, which are strategically valuable to the Group’s future AI roadmap. The acquisition of the Target Company brings several strategic advantages to the Group. The Target Company’s modular AI framework, including trained language models, multilingual natural language processing, and automation logic, can be seamlessly integrated into the Group’s digital platforms, accelerating deployment timelines and eliminating the need for system development from scratch. Additionally, the Target Company’s proprietary AI speech-to-speech agent strengthens customer-facing AI tools, particularly benefiting the Group’s logistics and customer service operations. The Target Company’s integration- ready application programming interface and cloud architecture enhance platform synergy, enabling cost savings and long-term scalability across the Group’s ecosystem. Furthermore, onboarding the Target Company’s engineering team ensures the retention of AI expertise and continuity in development. Lastly, the Target Company’s technology plays a pivotal role in advancing the Group’s global customer service centers by integrating AI-driven chatbots, voice AI, and intelligent CRM tools, significantly improving efficiency, multilingual support, and 24/7 availability. – 3 – Market Benchmarking and Valuation Multiples The Target Company operates in the AI software sector, particularly in enterprise automation and conversational AI. To support valuation, the Company has reviewed a basket of comparable AI-focused listed companies in the United States and Hong Kong (the “Comparable Companies”). Details of the Comparable Companies are set out in the table below: Price-to- Price-to-sale earnings Company (stock code/ticker) Ratio RatioNote (times) (times) C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE: AI) 10.8 N.M. Xiao-I Corporation (Nasdaq: AIXI) 4.0 18.0 Beijing Fourth Paradigm Technology Co., Ltd. (HKEX: 6682) 6.4 N.M. XtalPi Holdings Limited (HKEX: 2228) 65.0 N.M. Perfect Corp. (NYSE: PERF) 5.2 N.M. Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE: PLTR) 22.0 165.0 SenseTime Group Inc. (HKEX: 0020) 12.8 N.M. SoundHound AI, Inc. (Nasdaq: SOUN) 26.5 N.M. Average 19.1 91.5 Median 11.8 91.5 Note: N.M. stands for not meaningful. Based on the unaudited revenue of the Target Company for the year ended 31 March 2025 of approximately HK$2.88 million, the consideration for the Acquisition of HK$11,922,600 implies a price-to-sale ratio of 4.1 times and a price-to-earnings ratio of 35.2 times, which is at the lower end of the observed trading range for the Comparable Companies. Given that the Target Company has transitioned into AI-focused operations only in recent years, the above ratios are considered conservative relative to its product roadmap and anticipated scalability. – 4 – Commercial Justification and Reasonableness of Valuation The Company considers the consideration for the Acquisition of HK$11,922,600 to be fair and reasonable, given the Target Company’s proprietary AI software, trained models, and internal research and development efforts, which would require significant time and cost if developed independently. The integration of the Target Company’s AI engine and engineering resources is expected to generate substantial cost savings, accelerate market deployment, and enhance the Group’s core logistics and platform services with AI- driven differentiation. Additionally, the Group plans to leverage the Target Company’s AI capabilities to modernize global customer service operations, offering multilingual, real- time and scalable support. The Target Company has already achieved profitability, with an unaudited gross profit for the year ended 31 March 2025 of approximately HK$1.93 million, reflecting a price-to-earnings ratio of 35.2 times, which is considered favourable given its growth prospects and valuable intellectual property. Consideration Shares The Consideration Shares shall be allotted and issued pursuant to the General Mandate, credited as fully paid, and shall rank pari passu in all respects among themselves and with the Shares in issue on the date of such allotment and issue, including the right to receive all dividends and distributions which may be declared, made or paid after such allotment and issue, and will be issued free and clean of all liens, encumbrances, equities or other third party rights. The allotment and issue of the Consideration Shares under the General Mandate is within the limit of the General Mandate and is not subject to the approval of the Shareholders. The number of Consideration Shares to be allotted and issued to the Vendor shall be 3,100,000 new Shares, which represent approximately 4.93% of the issued share capital of the Company as at the date of this announcement and approximately 4.70% of the issued share capital of the Company as enlarged by the allotment and issuance of the Consideration Shares in full. The Issue Price of HK$3.846: (i) represents a discount of approximately 0.62% over the closing price of HK$3.87 per Share as quoted on the Stock Exchange on 12 June 2025, being the date of the Agreement; (ii) represents a discount of approximately 1.40% over the average closing price of HK$3.90 per Share as quoted on the Stock Exchange for the five (5) trading days immediately prior to the Agreement; and – 5 – (iii) represents a discount of approximately 0.62% over the average closing price of HK$3.87 per Share as quoted on the Stock Exchange for the twenty (20) trading days immediately prior to the Agreement. The Issue Price was arrived at after arm’s length negotiations between the Vendor and the Purchaser to the Agreement after taking into account, among others, the prevailing market price of the Shares and the current market conditions. The Directors consider that the Issue Price is fair and reasonable and in the interests of the Company and its Shareholders as a whole. An application has been made to the Stock Exchange by the Company for the listing of, and permission to deal in, the Consideration Shares. Conditions Precedent Completion is conditional upon the following conditions being fulfilled and remaining satisfied as at Completion or, where applicable, waived by the Vendor/Purchaser in accordance with the Agreement: (a) the granting of the approval for the listing of, and permission to deal in, the Consideration Shares by the Listing Committee of the Stock Exchange; (b) there shall have been no Material Adverse Event with respect to the Target Company during the period up to Completion; (c) no Governmental Authority having proposed or enacted any applicable Law, or taken any measure or action that would prohibit, restrict, impose conditions of limitations on or materially delay the continuation of the transactions contemplated under the Agreement; (d) the representations and warranties of the Vendor as set out in the Agreement remaining true and correct in as of the Completion Date; (e) the Vendor having performed and complied in all material respects with all, and not be in breach of or default in any material respects under any agreements, covenants, conditions and obligations contained in the Agreement that are required to be performed or complied with on or before Completion; (f) all necessary authorisations, consents, licences, agreements, approvals or permissions of any kind of, from or by third parties and/or government or regulatory authorities (if any) required to implement all the transactions contemplated hereunder having been obtained and remaining in full force and effect; and – 6 – (g) there being no bona fide legal, administrative or arbitration action, suit, claim, charge, hearing, injunction, enquiry, investigation or proceedings in effect, pending or to the best knowledge of the parties to the Agreement genuinely threatened as of Completion before any court, tribunal or arbitrator of a competent jurisdiction or by any Governmental Authority which seek to prohibit, restrict, impose condition or limitation on or otherwise challenge any of the transactions contemplated in the Agreement.

As at the Latest Practicable Date, the issued share capital of the Company comprised 62,882,739 Shares, with no treasury Shares. Subject to the passing of the resolution granting the Repurchase Mandate and on the basis that no further Shares are issued or repurchased before the Annual General Meeting, the Company will be allowed to repurchase a maximum of 6,288,273 Shares which represent 10% of the issued Shares (excluding any treasury Shares) during the period ending on the earlier of (i) the conclusion of the next annual general meeting of the Company; or (ii) the expiry of the period within which the next annual general meeting of the Company is required by any applicable laws or the Articles of Association to be held; or (iii) the passing of an ordinary resolution by Shareholders in general meeting of the Company revoking or varying such mandate. The Directors believe that it is in the best interests of the Company and the Shareholders to have a general authority from the Shareholders to enable the Company to repurchase its Shares in the market. Such repurchases may, depending on market conditions and funding arrangements at the time, lead to an enhancement of the Company’s net asset value and/or its earnings per Share and will only be made when the Directors believe that such repurchases will benefit the Company and the Shareholders as a whole. Repurchase of the Shares must be funded out of funds legally available for such purpose in accordance with the Articles of Association and the applicable laws of the Cayman Islands. The Directors may not repurchase the Shares on the Stock Exchange for a consideration other than cash or for settlement otherwise than in accordance with the trading rules of the Stock Exchange. Subject to the foregoing, the Directors may make repurchases with profits of the Company or out of a new issuance of shares made for the purpose of the repurchase or, if authorized by the Articles of Association and subject to the Companies Act, out of capital and, in the case of any premium payable on the repurchase, out of profits of the Company or from sums standing to the credit of the share premium account of the Company or, if authorized by the Articles of Association and subject to the Companies Act, out of capital. – 15 – The Directors have no present intention to repurchase any Shares and they would only exercise the power to repurchase in circumstances where they consider that the repurchase would be in the best interests of the Company and the Shareholders as a whole. The Directors believe that if the Repurchase Mandate is exercised in full at any time during the proposed repurchase period, it might have a material adverse impact on the working capital and/or gearing position of the Company, as compared with the positions disclosed in the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company as at December 31, 2024, being the date to which the latest published audited consolidated financial statements of the Company were made up. However, the Directors do not propose to exercise the Repurchase Mandate to such an extent as would, in the circumstances, have a material adverse effect on the working capital requirements of the Company or its gearing levels which, in the opinion of the Directors, are from time to time appropriate for the Company. None of the Directors nor, to the best of their knowledge, having made all reasonable enquiries, their respective close associates (as defined in the Listing Rules), have any present intention if the Repurchase Mandate is approved by the Shareholders, to sell any Shares to the Company. The Directors will exercise the Repurchase Mandate in accordance with the Listing Rules, the Articles of Association and the applicable laws of the Cayman Islands. The Company may cancel such repurchased Shares or hold them as treasury Shares, subject to market conditions and the Group’s capital management needs at the relevant time of the repurchases. For any treasury Shares deposited with CCASS pending resale on the Stock Exchange, the Company shall (i) procure its broker not to give any instructions to HKSCC to vote at general meetings of the Company for the treasury Shares deposited with CCASS; and (ii) in the case of dividends or distributions, withdraw the treasury Shares from CCASS, and either re-register them in its own name as treasury Shares or cancel them, in each case before the record date for the dividends or distributions, or take any other measures to ensure that it will not exercise any shareholders’ rights or receive any entitlements which would otherwise be suspended under the applicable laws if those Shares were registered in its own name as treasury Shares. As at the Latest Practicable Date, no core connected person (as defined in the Listing Rules) has notified the Company that he or she has a present intention to sell any Shares to the Company, or has undertaken not to do so, if the Repurchase Mandate is approved by the Shareholders. – 16 – The Directors confirm that to the best of their knowledge and belief, neither the explanatory statement nor the proposed repurchase of Shares pursuant to the Repurchase Mandate has any unusual features. If as a result of a repurchase of Shares pursuant to the Repurchase Mandate, a Shareholder’s proportionate interest in the voting rights of the Company increases, such increase will be treated as an acquisition of voting rights for the purposes of the Takeovers Code. Accordingly, a Shareholder, or a group of Shareholders acting in concert (within the meaning under the Takeovers Code), depending on the level of increase in the Shareholder’s interest, could obtain or consolidate control of the Company and thereby become obliged to make a mandatory offer in accordance with Rule 26 of the Takeovers Code. As at the Latest Practicable Date, according to the register kept by the Company pursuant to section 336 of the SFO and so far as is known to, or can be ascertained after reasonable enquiry by the Directors, 58.com is interested in 23,723,837 Shares, representing approximately 37.73% of the total number of Shares in issue. 58.com is wholly-owned by Quantum Bloom Group Ltd. (“Quantum Bloom”), which is controlled as to more than one-third by Mr. YAO Jinbo (through his intermediary controlled entities). Nihao Haven Corporation (“Nihao Haven”) controls over one-third interest in Quantum Bloom. Nihao Haven is wholly-owned by Nihao China Corporation (“Nihao China”) which is beneficially owned by Mr. YAO Jinbo through Credit Suisse Trust Limited as trustee. Accordingly, under the SFO, each of Quantum Bloom, Nihao Haven, Nihao China and Mr. YAO Jinbo is deemed to be interested in the entire equity interests held by 58.com in the Company. In the event that the Directors exercise in full the power to repurchase Shares under the Repurchase Mandate, then the attributable interest of 58.com would be increased from approximately 37.73% to approximately 41.92% of the total number of Shares in issue. To the best knowledge and belief of the Directors, such increase would give rise to an obligation to make a mandatory offer under the Takeovers Code. Save as aforesaid, the Directors are not aware of any other consequences which may arise under the Takeovers Code as a result of any repurchase of Shares pursuant to the Repurchase Mandate. The Directors have no present intention to repurchase the Shares to the extent that will trigger the obligations under the Takeovers Code for 58.com and Mr. YAO Jinbo to make a mandatory offer and will not effect repurchases to such extent which would result in the number of Shares held by the public falling below the minimum public float under the public float waiver granted by the Stock Exchange. – 17 – The Listing Rules prohibit a company from making repurchase on the Stock Exchange if the result of the repurchase would be that less than 25% (or such other prescribed minimum percentage as determined by the Stock Exchange) of the total number of issued shares of the Company would be in public hands. The Directors do not propose to repurchase Shares which would result in less than the prescribed minimum percentage of Shares in public hands. The Company has not purchased any of its Shares (whether on the Stock Exchange or otherwise) in the previous six months immediately preceding the Latest Practicable Date. The highest and lowest prices at which the Shares were traded on the Stock Exchange in each of the previous twelve months prior to and up to the Latest Practicable Date were as follows: Month Highest prices Lowest prices HK$ HK$ 2024 May 0.840 0.280 June 0.530 0.370 July 0.510 0.350 August 0.450 0.365 September 0.600 0.370 October 0.890 0.465 November 0.590 0.460 December 0.540 0.440 2025 January 0.455 0.370 February 0.750 0.400 March 0.580 0.350 April (note) 3.510 0.305 May (up to the Latest Practicable Date) 3.370 3.180 Note: The price per Share had been adjusted as a result of the share consolidation on the basis that every ten (10) issued and unissued existing shares of US$0.0000025 each in the share capital of the Company into one (1) consolidated share US$0.000025 each in the share capital of the Company, which became effective on Friday, 25April 2025. – 18 – 快 狗打 车控 股有 限公 司 (Incorporated in the Cayman Islands with limited liability) (Stock Code: 2246) NOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN THAT the annual general meeting of GOGOX HOLDINGS LIMITED (the “Company”, and its subsidiaries and Consolidated Affiliated Entities, collectively “Group”) will be held at Unit 1103−06, China Building, 29 Queen’s Road Central, Central, Hong Kong on Wednesday, June 18, 2025 at 10:00 a.m. for the following purposes: 1.

On December 23, 2024, Hainan WFOE, and the Consolidated Affiliated Entities and the Registered Shareholders enter into a new set of contractual Arrangements (the “New Contractual Arrangements”), which are on substantially the same terms and conditions as the Old Contractual Arrangements, mainly due to the (1) change of shareholder of Tianjin 58 Freight from Mr. Chen Xiaohua to Mr. He Song, and (2) the inclusion of two Consolidated Affiliated Entities established subsequently to the Old Contractual Arrangements and the Listing, namely Kuaigou Tianjin and Anhui Supeida.

    "text": "GOGOX HOLDINGS LIMITED Management Discussion and Analysis Overview In 2024, GoGoX reinforced its position as a premier online intra-city logistics platform in Asia, leveraging its technology-driven approach to enhance operational efficiency and deliver superior user experiences. Our mission remains steadfast: to simplify intra-city logistics through innovation, offering user-centric solutions that prioritize efficiency, transparency, and sustainability. With operations spanning over 370 cities across six countries and regions — including the Chinese mainland, Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, India, and Vietnam — we have continued to expand our geographic footprint and solidify our market presence. The company operates under two well-established brands: “Kuaigou Dache” in the Chinese mainland and “GoGoX” in other markets. By focusing on technology-enabled logistics solutions, we empower businesses and individuals with seamless, reliable, and cost-effective transportation services. Throughout the year, our intelligent platform facilitated deeper connections between drivers and shippers, fostering a robust and efficient logistics ecosystem. Despite a 12.3% year-on-year decline in total revenue to RMB660.1 million, primarily due to strategic adjustments in the Chinese mainland, revenue from Hong Kong and overseas markets demonstrated consistent growth, contributing 74.8% of total revenue-up from 62.0% in 2023. This growth was driven by enhanced service offerings, strategic partnerships, and improved customer engagement in international markets. As of December 31, 2024, our platform boasted 34.4 million registered shippers and 7.0 million registered drivers, supporting 14.5 million completed shipment orders and achieving a Gross Transaction Volume (GTV) of RMB1,626.3 million. These metrics underscore our ability to adapt to evolving market conditions while maintaining strong operational fundamentals. Service Offerings and Segments Platform Services Our platform services streamline logistics transactions by delivering a seamless and transparent experience for both drivers and shippers. In 2024, we facilitated approximately 12.9 million shipment orders, generating a GTV of RMB1,186.4 million. While revenue from platform services declined by 27.0% to RMB158.3 million, primarily due to a strategic reduction in user incentives in the Chinese mainland, our Hong Kong and overseas platform services grew by 9.9%. This growth reflects increased user engagement and improved service adoption, particularly in Hong Kong, South Korea, and Vietnam. In the Chinese mainland, we prioritized user retention by enhancing platform algorithms to improve route optimization and pricing transparency. Additionally, we scaled back promotional incentives to bolster long-term profitability. In Hong Kong and overseas markets, we introduced innovative driver engagement programs, streamlined onboarding processes, and integrated AI-driven demand prediction tools to optimize order matching and fulfillment rates. Notably, our Singaporean market experienced significant growth through strategic partnerships with e-commerce firms, further solidifying our presence in the region.",

The decrease was primarily due to (i) a decrease of employee benefit expenses (including share-based compensation expenses) of RMB11.2 million and (ii) a decrease of incentives to transacting users from platform services of RMB44.6 million. General and administrative expenses Our general and administrative expenses decreased by 38.3% from RMB269.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 to RMB166.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, primarily due to a decrease of employee benefit expenses (including share-based compensation expenses) of RMB96.0 million.

Impairment of goodwill We recorded impairment of goodwill of RMB98.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to RMB843.5 million in 2023. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired, and is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses, if any. Our goodwill mainly arose from the acquisition of structured entities and subsidiaries of GoGo Tech Holdings Limited in 2017. For details of such goodwill, please refer to “Financial Information — Discussion of Selected Items from the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position — Assets — Goodwill” in the prospectus of the Company dated June 14, 2022 (the “Prospectus”). We reviewed the business performance and monitored goodwill resulting from the acquisition on operating segment level. We performed the impairment test on goodwill by comparing the recoverable amounts of CGU or group of CGUs to the respective carrying amounts. We used the income approach, i.e. the discounted cash flow method, to determine the fair value of the CGUs. For details of the impairment test for goodwill, including the key assumptions adopted in determining the fair value of the CGUs, please refer to the section headed “Impairment test for goodwill” in note 17 to Consolidated Financial Statements for the Years Ended December 31, 2024.

Our reversal of impairment losses on financial assets amounted to RMB6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, primarily due to the improving management of accounts receivable collection.",

According to our Articles of Association and applicable laws and regulations, the decision on whether to pay dividends will be made at the discretion of our Directors and will depend upon, among others, the financial results, cash flow, business conditions and strategies, future operations and earnings, capital requirements and expenditure plans, any restrictions on payment of dividends, and other factors that our Directors may consider relevant. We do not have a pre-determined dividend payout ratio. We will evaluate our dividend policy in light of our financial condition and the prevailing economic environment. Subject to the Cayman Companies Act and the Articles of Association, through a general meeting, we may declare dividends in any currency, but no dividend may be declared unless out of either profit or share premium account and no dividend shall exceed the amount recommended by our Board. Any declaration of dividends will be at the absolute discretion of our Directors and will depend on our future operations and earnings, capital requirements and surplus, general financial conditions, contractual restrictions and other factors that our Directors consider relevant. Our Board may also from time to time pay interim dividends as our Board believes to be justified by the profits of our Company, as well as special dividends on shares of any class of such amounts and on such dates as it deems fit. The Directors may also pay half-yearly or at other intervals to be selected by them any dividend which may be payable at a fixed rate if they are of the opinion that the profits available for distribution justify the payment. We cannot guarantee in what form dividends will be paid in the future. As advised by our legal advisor on Cayman Islands law, Maples and Calder (Hong Kong) LLP, under the Companies Act (As Revised) of the Cayman Islands, a position of accumulated losses does not necessarily restrict us to declare and pay dividends to our Shareholders as dividends may be declared and paid out of our share premium account notwithstanding our profitability. As we are a holding company, our ability to declare and pay dividends will also depend on the availability of dividends received from our subsidiaries, including our PRC companies. PRC laws require that dividends be paid only out of the net profit calculated according to the PRC accounting principles. PRC laws also require foreign invested enterprises to set aside part of their net profit as statutory reserves, which are not available for distribution as cash dividends. Distributions from our subsidiaries may also be restricted if they incur debt or losses or in accordance with any restrictive covenants in bank credit facilities or other agreements that we or our subsidiaries may enter into in the future.

The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the Historical Financial Information are disclosed in Note 4.

The Group has applied, for the first time, the following revised IFRSs that are relevant to the Group: Amendments to IAS 1: Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current The amendments aim to promote consistency in applying the requirements by helping companies determine whether, in the balance sheet, debt and other liabilities with an uncertain settlement date should be classified as current (due or potentially due to be settled within one year) or non-current. The amendments include clarifying the classification requirements for debt a company might settle by converting it into equity. The adoption of the amendments does not have any significant impact on the consolidated financial statements. Amendments to IAS 1: Non-current Liabilities with Covenants The amendments specify that covenants to be complied with after the reporting date do not affect the classification of debt as current or non-current at the reporting date.

The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power to direct the activities of the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases. The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for business combinations by the Group (Note 33.2). Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between group companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the transferred asset. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group. Non-controlling interests in the results and equity of subsidiaries are shown separately in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated balance sheet respectively. 196 GOGOX HOLDINGS LIMITED Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements",

Investors grant their share options to the Group’s eligible employees and consultants. The Group has no obligation to settle the share-based payment transaction and measures the services received as an equity-settled share-based payment transaction. Investors’ Incentive Plan is disclosed in Note 25. In terms of the share options awarded to employees, the total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of options granted: • including any market performance conditions; • excluding the impact of any service and non-market performance vesting conditions; and • including the impact of any non-vesting conditions. Non-marketing performance and service conditions are included in calculation of the number of share options that are expected to vest. The total amount expensed is recognised over the vesting period, which is the period over which all of the specified vesting conditions are to be satisfied. At the end of each reporting period, the Group revises its estimates of the number of share options that are expected to vest based on the non-marketing performance and service conditions. It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, with a corresponding adjustment to equity. In some circumstances, employees may provide services in advance of the grant date and therefore the grant date fair value is estimated for the purposes of recognising the expense during the period between service commencement period and grant date.

The Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability with respect to all lease agreements in which it is the lessee, except for short-term leases (defined as leases with a lease term of 12 months or less) and leases of low value assets. For these leases, the Group recognises the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, and payments for these leases are presented in the consolidated statement of cash flows from operating activities. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted by using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If this rate cannot be readily determined, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate specific to the lease, e.g. country, term, security and currency of the contract. In addition, the Group considers its recent debt issuances as well as publicly available data for instruments with similar characteristics when calculating the incremental borrowing rates. Lease payments include fixed payments, less any lease incentives, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate known at the commencement date, and purchase options or extension option payments if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise these options. Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or rate are not included in the measurement of the lease liability and right-of-use asset and are recognised as an expense in the profit or loss in the period in which the event or condition that triggers those payments occurs. A lease liability is remeasured upon a change in the lease term, changes in an index or rate used to determine the lease payments or reassessment of exercise of a purchase option. The corresponding adjustment is made to the related right-of-use asset. The right-of-use assets comprise the initial measurement of the corresponding lease liability, lease payments made at or before the commencement date and any initial direct costs. They are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. The right-of-use assets are depreciated starting at the commencement date over the shorter period of useful life of the underlying asset and lease term. The lease liability is presented in the ‘Lease liabilities’ line and the right-of-use assets are presented in the ‘Right-of-use assets’ line in the consolidated balance sheet. In addition, the principal portion of the lease payments and the interest component are presented within financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows. Lease payments are allocated between the principal and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to profit or loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period. 214 GOGOX HOLDINGS LIMITED Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements",

After the Redemption, the Group ceases to hold any interests in the Fund. The proceeds from the Redemption is HK$66,179,785.77. This represents a gain of HK$1,179,785.77, being the difference between the proceeds from the Redemption and the Subscription Amount of HK$65,000,000 of the Fund redeemed. The information contained in this announcement related to the amount of gain on Redemption is only based on the preliminary review of the information currently available to the Company, which has not been audited by the auditors of the Company. The actual amount of gain to be recorded is subject to review and audit by the auditors of the Company. The Fund is an exempted company incorporated with limited liability and registered as a segregated portfolio company under the laws of the Cayman Islands. As a segregated portfolio company, the Fund is permitted to create one or more segregated portfolios in order to segregate the assets and liabilities of the Fund held in respect of one segregated portfolio from the assets and liabilities of the Fund held in respect of any other segregated portfolio and/or the general assets and liabilities of the Fund. The Fund has been registered as a regulated mutual fund with the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority under Section 4(3) of the Mutual Funds Act (as amended) of the Cayman Islands. The Manager is a company incorporated in Hong Kong with limited liability. It is licensed with CE number BSJ934 for Type 4 (advising on securities) and Type 9 (asset management) regulated activities. – 2 – To the best of the Directors’ knowledge, information and belief, having made all reasonable enquiries, each of the Fund, the Segregated Portfolio, the Manager and their ultimate beneficial owners are third parties independent of the Company and connected persons of the Company. The Company is an exempted company with limited liability incorporated under the laws of Cayman Islands on 8 June 2017 and is principally engaged in investment holding, the shares of which are listed on the Main Board of the Stock Exchange. The Group is a major online intra-city logistics platform in Asia. The Group’s service offerings consist of platform services, enterprise services, as well as a growing range of value-added services. Having considered the expected return on the Redemption, the Directors consider that the Redemption represents a good opportunity for the Group to realise its investment, allowing it to reallocate the Group’s resources to other existing businesses. Furthermore, in view of the recent volatile market conditions and heightened uncertainties with regard to global central bank policies and economic outlook, the Board considered that it was prudent and necessary to adopt a more cautious investment strategy which required the liquidation of investment in the Fund to prevent potential losses and conduct the Redemption to increase cash reserve of the Group. Furthermore, the Group intends to use the proceeds from the Redemption for general working capital and to support the development of its core business. The Directors are of the view that the terms of the Redemption are entered into in the ordinary course of business of the Group, on normal commercial terms, are fair and reasonable and the Redemption is in the interests of the Company and the Shareholders as a whole.

    "text": "million shipment orders, generating a GTV of RMB1,186.4 million. While revenue from platform services declined by 27.0% to RMB158.3 million, primarily due to a strategic reduction in user incentives in the Chinese mainland, our Hong Kong and overseas platform services grew by 9.9%. This growth reflects increased user engagement and improved service adoption, particularly in Hong Kong, South Korea, and Vietnam. In the Chinese mainland, we prioritized user retention by enhancing platform algorithms to improve route optimization and pricing transparency. Additionally, we scaled back promotional incentives to bolster long-term profitability. In Hong Kong and overseas markets, we introduced innovative driver engagement programs, streamlined onboarding processes, and integrated AI-driven demand prediction tools to optimize order matching and fulfillment rates. Notably, our Singaporean market experienced significant growth through strategic partnerships with e-commerce firms, further solidifying our presence in the region. Enterprise Services Our enterprise services provide scalable, customized intra-city logistics solutions tailored to businesses of all sizes. In 2024, we successfully completed 1.5 million deliveries for enterprise clients, achieving a GTV of RMB439.9 million. While revenue from enterprise services declined by 5.8% to RMB435.6 million, this was largely due to a strategic shift in the Chinese mainland, where we phased out lower-margin contracts in favor of higher-value enterprise engagements. In the Chinese mainland, we enhanced our service offerings by integrating real-time tracking and advanced data analytics into our logistics management system. This improved operational transparency and efficiency, fostering stronger long-term partnerships with key clients. Conversely, enterprise services in Hong Kong and overseas markets expanded steadily, driven by robust partnerships and increasing demand for tailored logistics solutions. Vietnam emerged as a standout market, with revenue surging by 42.7% year-on-year. In India, we expanded our coverage to 25 states, 5 union territories and over 100 cities, laying a strong foundation for future growth. Additionally, in Korea, we have penetrated the bio cold chain market by acquiring new global clients, further strengthening our presence in the region. – 17 – Value-Added Services Our value-added services complement our core offerings by providing additional solutions such as vehicle sales facilitation and fuel card programs. In 2024, revenue from value-added services reached RMB66.2 million, reflecting a 10.1% decrease from RMB73.6 million in 2023. This decline was primarily attributed to a slowdown in vehicle sales facilitation in the Chinese mainland, offset by strong growth in Hong Kong and overseas markets. In the Chinese mainland, we adapted our vehicle sales strategy by partnering with larger fleet operators and introducing leasing options to drive higher adoption rates among drivers. In Hong Kong and overseas markets, we expanded our fuel card discount program, which improved driver retention despite lower overall revenue from this segment. Revenue from value-added services in these markets grew by 22.8% year-on-year, driven by enhanced supplier partnerships and targeted sales efforts. Business Outlook As we enter 2025, our strategic focus remains on accelerating growth in high-potential overseas markets, refining our service offerings, and leveraging cutting-edge technology to enhance operational efficiencies. The consistent and growing contribution from Hong Kong and overseas markets highlights the resilience of our business model and our ability to adapt to shifting market dynamics. By continuing to innovate in logistics solutions, deepening customer engagement, and expanding our global footprint, we are well-positioned to sustain long-term growth and reinforce our leadership in the intra-city logistics sector. Our commitment to delivering value to stakeholders remains unwavering as we navigate the evolving landscape of logistics and transportation. – 18 – Overview For the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company achieved total revenue of RMB660.1 million, representing a decrease of 12.3% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. In the same reporting period, gross profit was RMB218.7 million, representing a 15.2% year-on-year decrease. The adjusted net loss and adjusted EBITDA1 were RMB86.1 million and negative RMB68.3 million, respectively. The basic and diluted losses per share were RMB31 cents and RMB176 cents for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Capital Expenditure was RMB2.6 million as at December 31, 2024. Year Ended December 31, 2024 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2023 Revenue In 2024, the Company’s revenue was RMB660.1 million, representing a decrease of 12.3% from RMB752.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. The following table sets forth a breakdown of our revenue by business line and geographical region in absolute terms of our revenue for the years indicated. Year ended December 31, 2024 Year ended December 31, 2023 Year-on-year change Chinese Hong Kong Chinese Hong Kong Chinese Hong Kong mainland and overseas mainland and overseas mainland and overseas operations operations Total operations operations Total operations operations Total RMB’000 RMB’000 RMB’000 RMB’000 RMB’000 RMB’000 RMB’000 RMB’000 RMB’000 Revenue: Logistics services provided to enterprise customers 72,224 363,393 435,617 108,524 353,877 462,401 (36,300) 9,516 (26,784) Service income from logistics services platforms 87,534 70,761 158,295 152,483 64,361 216,844 (64,949) 6,400 (58,549) Value-added services 6,628 59,579 66,207 25,045 48,528 73,573 (18,417) 11,051 (7,366) Total 166,386 493,733 660,119 286,052 466,766 752,818 (119,666) 26,967 (92,699) 1. Adjusted net loss represents loss for the year before (i) share-based compensation expenses and (ii) impairment of goodwill. Adjusted EBITDA represents adjusted net loss for the year before (i) income tax credit, (ii) depreciation and amortization, and (iii) net finance income. The Company believes that these items should be adjusted for when calculating our adjusted net loss and adjusted EBITDA in order to provide potential investors with a complete and fair understanding of our operating results, especially in making year-on-year comparisons of, and assessing the profile of, our operating and financial performance, and making comparisons with other comparable companies with similar business operations. – 19 – Enterprise services The revenue from enterprise services decreased by 5.8% from RMB462.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 to RMB435.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, primarily in relation to the reduction of shipping volume as we gradually phased out lower- margin contracts in favor of higher-value enterprise engagements in the Chinese mainland market, partially offset by the business growth in Hong Kong and overseas market. Platform services The revenue from platform services decreased by 27.0% from RMB216.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 to RMB158.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. This decrease is primarily due to the decrease in revenue generated from the Chinese mainland in relation to the intensified competition and the shift of strategic decisions aimed at optimizing our service offerings and improving profitability, and partially offset by the increase in Hong Kong and overseas market, primarily propelled by improving our engagement model with our drivers and shippers. Value-added services Revenue from value-added services decreased by 10.1% from RMB73.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 to RMB66.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, primarily due to the decrease of platform fleet operators service fee (平台車隊運營商服務 費) in the Chinese mainland market, and partially offset by the increase in Hong Kong and overseas market. Cost of revenue Our cost of revenue decreased by 10.8% from RMB494.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 to RMB441.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, mainly due to (i) a decrease of subcontracting fee of RMB32.1 million, and (ii) a decrease of services charges of RMB11.7 million, and (iii) the decrease of employee benefit expenses (including share-based compensation expenses) and other costs. Gross profit and gross profit margin As a result of the foregoing, we recorded (i) a gross profit of RMB257.9 million and RMB218.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively, and (ii) a gross profit margin of 34.3% and 33.1% for the same periods, respectively. – 20 – The following table sets forth our gross profit and gross profit margin for the years indicated. Year ended December 31, 2024 2023 Year-on-year change RMB’000 RMB’000 RMB’000 % Revenue 660,119 752,818 (92,699) (12.3) Cost of revenue (441,411) (494,923) 53,512 (10.8) Gross profit 218,708 257,895 (39,187) (15.2) Gross profit margin 33.1% 34.3% — — Selling and marketing expenses Our selling and marketing expenses decreased by 25.6% from RMB203.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 to RMB151.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. The decrease was primarily due to (i) a decrease of employee benefit expenses (including share-based compensation expenses) of RMB11.2 million and (ii) a decrease of incentives to transacting users from platform services of RMB44.6 million. General and administrative expenses Our general and administrative expenses decreased by 38.3% from RMB269.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 to RMB166.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, primarily due to a decrease of employee benefit expenses (including share-based compensation expenses) of RMB96.0 million. Research and development expenses Our research and development expenses decreased by 41.8% from RMB38.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 to RMB22.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease of employee benefit expenses (including share-based compensation expenses) of RMB16.4 million. Impairment of goodwill We recorded impairment of goodwill of RMB98.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, as compared to RMB843.5 million in 2023. – 21 – Goodwill is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired, and is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses, if any. Our goodwill mainly arose from the acquisition of structured entities and subsidiaries of GoGo Tech Holdings Limited in 2017. For details of such goodwill, please refer to “Financial Information — Discussion of Selected Items from the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position — Assets — Goodwill” in the prospectus of the Company dated June 14, 2022 (the “Prospectus”). We reviewed the business performance and monitored goodwill resulting from the acquisition on operating segment level. We performed the impairment test on goodwill by comparing the recoverable amounts of CGU or group of CGUs to the respective carrying amounts. We used the income approach, i.e. the discounted cash flow method, to determine the fair value of the CGUs. For details of the impairment test for goodwill, including the key assumptions adopted in determining the fair value of the CGUs, please refer to the section headed “Impairment test for goodwill” in note 9 to Consolidated Financial Statements for the Years Ended December 31, 2024. Reversal of/(provision for) impairment losses on financial assets, net We recorded impairment losses on financial assets of RMB17.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Our reversal of impairment losses on financial assets amounted to RMB6.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, primarily due to the improving management of accounts receivable collection. Other income Our other income decreased by 49.5% from RMB9.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 to RMB4.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, primarily due to the decrease of government subsidies and the absence of recurrence of one-off service provided by the Company in the Chinese mainland, partially offset by an increase of government subsidies in Hong Kong. Other gains, net Our other net gains increased by 67.9% from RMB2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 to RMB4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, primarily due to the increase of net foreign exchange gains and the reversal of provision for PRC tax penalty. Operating loss As a result of the foregoing, our operating loss decreased by 81.4% from RMB1,102.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 to RMB204.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. – 22 – Net finance income Our net finance income for the year ended December 31, 2024 was RMB1.3 million, which was essentially unchanged from 2023. Income tax credit Our income tax credit increased by 268.0% from RMB2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 to RMB9.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. We recorded current income tax expenses of RMB0.9 million in 2023 and current income tax credit of RMB7.0 million in 2024, primarily due to the reversal of income tax liabilities according to relevant tax laws and regulations in 2024. Loss for the year Our loss for the year decreased by 82.4% from RMB1,100.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 to RMB194.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. Non-IFRS Measures To supplement this announcement, which is presented in accordance with IFRSs, we also presented the adjusted net loss and adjusted EBITDA as additional financial measures. The management believes that the presentation of adjusted net loss (a non-IFRS measure) and adjusted EBITDA (a non-IFRS measure) would facilitate comparisons of operating performance from year-on-year and comparisons with other comparable companies with similar business operations by eliminating the potential impact of certain items. We define adjusted net loss (a non-IFRS measure) as loss for the year adjusted for (i) share-based compensation expenses and (ii) impairment of goodwill. In 2024, our adjusted net loss was RMB86.1 million, down by 49.4% as compared to 2023. We define adjusted EBITDA as adjusted net loss for the year adjusted for (i) income tax credit, (ii) depreciation and amortization, and (iii) net finance income. In 2024, our adjusted EBITDA was negative RMB68.3 million, down by 51.4% as compared to 2023. – 23 – The following table reconciles our adjusted net loss (a non-IFRS measure) and adjusted EBITDA for the years presented to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented under IFRS, which is loss for the years.

As at December 31, 2024, the fair value of our investment in the fund was approximately RMB60.2 million, which constituted 9.7% of the total assets of the Group.

The Group is committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance to safeguard the interests of the Shareholders and to enhance corporate value and accountability. The Company has adopted the Corporate Governance Code (the “CG Code”) contained in Appendix C1 to the Listing Rules as its own code of corporate governance. Save as disclosed in this annual results announcement, the Company has, to the best knowledge of the Directors, complied with all applicable code provisions as set out in Part 2 of the CG Code for the year ended December 31, 2024. Mr. Lam Hoi Yuen (“Mr. Lam”), an executive Director of the Company and co-chief executive officer (the “Co-CEO”) of the Company, was appointed by the Board as the chairman of the Board (the “Chairman”) with effect from December 20, 2023. Mr. Lam was appointed as a Director on August 29, 2017, and re-designated as an executive Director on August 13, 2021. Mr. Lam was appointed as a Co-CEO on August 29, 2017. Following the re-designation of Mr. Lam, he becomes the Chairman with effect from December 20, 2023 and continues to serve as Co-CEO. Such practice deviates from the code provision C.2.1 of the CG Code. In view of Mr. Lam’s profile, extensive relevant industry knowledge and experience, the Board has confidence in vesting the roles of both the Chairman and Co-CEO in Mr. Lam and believes that this will allow for more effective planning and execution of business strategies of the Group. Therefore, the Board considers that the deviation from the code provision C.2.1 of the CG Code will not be inappropriate. – 29 – In addition, under the supervision of the Board which, apart from Mr. Lam being an executive Director, comprise one executive Director, two non-executive Directors and three independent non-executive Directors, the Board is appropriately structured with balance of power to provide sufficient checks and balances to protect the interests of the Company and its shareholders. The Company will continue to review and monitor its corporate governance practices to ensure compliance with the CG Code, and maintain a high standard of corporate governance practices of the Company.

The decrease in loss attributable to the equity holders of the Company was mainly due to a decrease in the impairment of goodwill and a decrease in the employee benefit expenses (including share-based compensation expenses). The Company is still in the process of finalizing its results for the year ended 31 December 2024.

    "text": "of the Rules Governing the Listing of Securities on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited (the “Listing Rules”). The board of directors of the Company (the “Board”) announces that the Company has resolved to request PricewaterhouseCoopers (“PwC”) to resign as the auditor of the Company. PwC has accepted such request and has tendered its resignation as the auditor of the Company with effect from September 12, 2024. This decision follows the Board’s resolution to propose to appoint Forvis Mazars CPA Limited as the new auditor for the financial year ending December 31, 2024, considering the competitive proposed audit fee by Forvis Mazars CPA Limited. The Company is incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands and to the knowledge of the Board, there is no requirement under the laws of Cayman Islands for the resigning auditor to confirm to the Company whether or not there is any circumstance connected with their resignation which they consider should be brought to the attention of the shareholders of the Company (the “Shareholders”). PwC has therefore not issued such a confirmation. The Board and the audit committee of the Company (the “Audit Committee”) also confirmed that there is no disagreement between PwC and the Company, and there are no other matters in respect of the resignation of PwC as the auditor of the Company that need to be brought to the attention of the Shareholders. – 1 – The Board further confirmed that PwC has not yet commenced any audit work on the financial statements of the Group for the financial year ending December 31, 2024. It is therefore expected that the change of auditor will not have any significant impact on the annual audit and the release of annual results of the Group for the year ending December 31, 2024. The Board would like to take this opportunity to express its sincere gratitude to PwC for its professional and quality services rendered to the Company during the past years. Pursuant to Article 29.2 of the articles of association of the Company, the Board has the power to fill the vacancy in the office of auditor and to fix the remuneration of the auditor so appointed. The Board, with the recommendation from the Audit Committee, has resolved to appoint Forvis Mazars CPA Limited as the auditor of the Company with effect from September 12, 2024, to fill the vacancy following the resignation of PwC and to hold office until the conclusion of the next annual general meeting of the Company. Accordingly, no extraordinary general meeting will be held for the said appointment of Forvis Mazars CPA Limited. Forvis Mazars CPA Limited is independent of the Company. In assessing the eligibility and suitability of Forvis Mazars CPA Limited, the Audit Committee and the Board has taken into account: (i) Forvis Mazars CPA Limited’s standing as a leading global professional services firm; (ii) Forvis Mazars CPA Limited’s extensive experience, industry knowledge and technical competence in providing audit work to listed companies; (iii) Forvis Mazars CPA Limited’s independence from the Group and its objectivity; (iv) Forvis Mazars CPA Limited’s resources and capabilities, including the size and structure of the proposed audit team; (v) The proposed fee for the audit services to be rendered by Forvis Mazars CPA Limited, which would allow the Company to meet its cost management objectives; and (vi) The Guidelines for Effective Audit Committees — Selection, Appointment and Reappointment of Auditors and Guidance Notes on Change of Auditors published by the Accounting and Financial Reporting Council. – 2 – The Board and the Audit Committee believe that this change will enhance the cost-effectiveness of the Company’s annual audit, and is in the interest of the Company and its Shareholders as a whole. The Board would like to take this opportunity to welcome Forvis Mazars CPA Limited on its appointment as the auditor of the Company.

General and administrative expenses Our general and administrative expenses decreased by 34.6% from RMB118.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 to RMB77.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024, primarily due to the decrease of employee benefit expenses (including share-based compensation). Research and development expenses Our research and development expenses decreased by 48.4% from RMB22.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 to RMB11.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024. The decrease was primarily attributable to the decrease of employee benefit expenses (including share-based compensation expenses). – 25 – Reversal of impairment losses/(impairment losses) on financial assets Our impairment losses on financial assets amounted to RMB2.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023. We recorded a reversal of impairment losses on financial assets of RMB4.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024, primarily due to the improvement of account receivable management, the decreased long-aging accounts receivables and the reduction of total accounts receivables balance. Impairment of goodwill We recorded impairment loss of goodwill of RMB51.0 million in relation to the Chinese mainland operations cash-generating unit (“CGU”) for the six months ended June 30, 2024, as compared to RMB513.5 million for the corresponding period in 2023 both in relation to the Chinese mainland operations CGU and the Hong Kong and overseas operations CGU. Given that the overall economic recovery fell short of expectation, the intensified competition especially for Chinese mainland operations, and the shift of strategic decisions aimed at optimizing our service offerings and improving profitability, the growth in revenue and earnings of the Group’s Chinese mainland operations for the first half of 2024 did not meet the original growth expectation. In light of the above, the management of the Company revised the five years forecast of future revenue growth for our enterprise services and platform services with the expectation that recoverable amounts of such CGU will decline and become lower than the carrying amounts, resulting in an impairment loss on goodwill in relation to the Chinese mainland operations CGU in current period. And we considered there is no indication of impairment in relation to the Hong Kong and overseas operation CGU as at June 30, 2024 and thus, no impairment on goodwill in relation to the Hong Kong and overseas operation CGU had been recorded during the current period. Other income Our other income increased by 276.2% from RMB1.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 to RMB4.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024, primarily due to the increase of government subsidies we received in Chinese mainland in the first half of 2024. Other net gains We recorded other net gains of RMB3.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024, primarily due to exchange rate gains. We recorded other net gains of RMB1.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023, primarily representing fair value gains from financial assets at fair value through profit or loss. – 26 – Operating loss As a result of the foregoing, our operating loss decreased by 86.9% from RMB645.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 to RMB84.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024. Net finance income Our net finance income decreased by 41.8% from RMB0.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 to RMB0.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024, primarily due to the decrease of interest income from bank deposit. Income tax credit Our income tax credit decreased by 47.1% from RMB2.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 to RMB1.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024, primarily in relation to utilisation of deferred income tax liabilities. Loss for the period Our loss for the period decreased by 87.1% from RMB642.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 to RMB82.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2024. Non-IFRS Measures To supplement this announcement, which is presented in accordance with IFRSs, we also presented the adjusted net loss and adjusted EBITDA as additional financial measures. The management believes that the presentation of adjusted net loss (a non-IFRS measure) and adjusted EBITDA (a non-IFRS measure) would facilitate comparisons of operating performance from period to period and comparisons with other comparable companies with similar business operations by eliminating the potential impact of certain items. In the first half of 2024, our adjusted net loss was RMB33.8 million, down by 72.1% as compared to the corresponding period of 2023. We define adjusted net loss (a non-IFRS measure) as loss for the period adjusted for (i) share-based compensation expenses, and (ii) impairment of goodwill. In particular, we consider these non-IFRS measures as an additional analytical tool to assess our operating results without the effect of certain non-cash items, such as share-based compensation expenses and impairment of goodwill. Further, impairment of goodwill are typically one-off and non-recurring in nature. Share-based compensation expenses consist of non-cash expenses arising from granting share options, – 27 – restricted shares and restricted share units to eligible individuals under the share incentive plan of the Company adopted on August 18, 2021 (the “Share Incentive Plan”). For details of our goodwill impairment, see “Management Discussion and Analysis — Financial Review — Impairment of Goodwill” in this announcement. In the first half of 2024, our adjusted EBITDA was negative RMB21.2 million, representing a decrease of 80.1% as compared to the corresponding period of 2023. We define adjusted EBITDA as adjusted net loss for the period adjusted for the netting of the following: (i) income tax credit, (ii) depreciation and amortization, and (iii) net finance income. The following table reconciles our adjusted net loss (a non-IFRS measure) and adjusted EBITDA (a non-IFRS measure) for the period presented to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented under IFRS, which is loss for the periods.

(2) Represents adjusted net loss for the period before (i) income tax credit, (ii) depreciation and amortization and (iii) net finance income. Capital Structure, Liquidity and Capital Resources As at June 30, 2024, the Company’s issued share capital was approximately US$1,571.3 divided into 628,507,372 shares of US$0.0000025 each, and the total equity of the Group was approximately RMB396.0 million. For the six months ended June 30, 2024, we satisfied our cash requirements principally from cash generated from daily operations and equity financing activities in relation to the Listing. Our cash and cash equivalents represent cash and bank balances. We had cash and cash equivalents of RMB363.0 million as of June 30, 2024.

We currently do not have any other plans for material additional external financing. Significant Investments Held We recorded financial assets at fair value through profit or loss amounting to nil as of June 30, 2024 (as of December 31, 2023: RMB206.8 million). The financial assets at fair value through profit or loss primarily include wealth management products previously purchased from different segregated portfolio companies that are independent from the Company and independent from each other, and were redeemed before June 30, 2024 for the purpose of the Company’s fund management. Such wealth management products are principal- guaranteed and carry interest at fixed rates ranging from 1.2% to 1.6% per annum. The investment scope of such products is primarily cash, bank deposits, U.S. treasury bonds and other money market instruments. – 30 – Save as disclosed above, the Group did not make or hold any significant investments during the six months ended June 30, 2024. Future Plans for Material Investments and Capital Assets As of June 30, 2024, we did not have any other plans for material investments and capital assets.

Employee and Remuneration Policy As of June 30, 2024, we had 728 (June 30, 2023: 1,004) full-time employees (inclusive of outsourced personnel) located in various jurisdictions in which we operate.

We are required under PRC laws to make contributions to employee benefit plans at specific percentages of employee salaries, bonuses and certain allowances of our employees, up to a maximum amount specified by the local government from time to time. We participate in and make contributions to those social security plans and employee benefit plans. The Company also makes payments to other defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans for the benefit of employees employed by subsidiaries outside of the Chinese mainland as required by the applicable laws. – 31 – Our success depends on our ability to attract, retain and motivate high-quality talents. As part of our human resources strategy, we offer employees competitive salaries, performance-based cash bonuses and other incentives. In order to recognize and acknowledge the contributions made by certain of management members, employees and consultants, the Company has also adopted the Share Incentive Plan on August 18, 2021. We have adopted a training protocol in Chinese mainland, pursuant to which we provide pre-employment and ongoing management and technical training to our employees. The employee benefit expenses, including share-based compensation expenses, for the six months ended June 30, 2024 were RMB93.3 million, as compared to RMB147.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023, representing a period-to-period decrease of 36.7%. Gearing Ratio As of June 30, 2024, the gearing ratio, calculated as total borrowings divided by total equity attributable to owners of the Company, was not applicable as the Company’s borrowing amounted to nil as of the same date. Foreign Exchange Risk We operate in Asian countries and are exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with respect to US dollars, Hong Kong dollars, Singapore dollars, South Korean Won and Vietnamese Dong. Foreign exchange risk arises when future commercial transactions or recognized assets and liabilities are denominated in a currency that is not the respective functional currency of our subsidiaries. We currently do not hedge transactions undertaken in foreign currencies.

The Group is committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance to safeguard the interests of the shareholders of the Company and to enhance corporate value and accountability. The Company has adopted the Corporate Governance Code (the “Corporate Governance Code”) set out in Appendix C1 to the Rules Governing the Listing of Securities on the Stock Exchange (the “Listing Rules”) as its own code of corporate governance. The Company has, to the best knowledge of the Directors, complied with all applicable code provisions as set out in Part 2 of the Corporate Governance Code during the Reporting Period. Mr. Lam Hoi Yuen (“Mr. Lam”), an executive Director of the Company and co-chief executive officer (the “Co-CEO”) of the Company, has been appointed by the Board as the chairman of the Board (the “Chairman”) with effect from December 20, 2023. Mr. Lam was appointed as a Director on August 29, 2017, and re-designated as an executive Director on August 13, 2021. Mr. Lam was appointed as a Co-CEO on August 29, 2017. Following the re-designation of Mr. Lam, he becomes the Chairman with effect from December 20, 2023 and continues to serve as Co-CEO. Such practice deviates from the code provision C.2.1 of the Corporate Governance Code. In view of Mr. Lam’s profile, extensive relevant industry knowledge and experience, the Board has confidence in vesting the roles of both the Chairman and Co-CEO in Mr. Lam and believes that this will allow for more effective planning and execution of business strategies of the Group. Therefore, the Board considers that the deviation from the code provision C.2.1 of the Corporate Governance Code will not be inappropriate. In addition, under the supervision of the Board which, apart from Mr. Lam being an executive Director, comprise one executive Director, two non-executive Directors and three independent non-executive Directors, the Board is appropriately structured with balance of power to provide sufficient checks and balances to protect the interests of the Company and its shareholders. The Company will continue to regularly review and monitor its corporate governance practices to ensure compliance with the Corporate Governance Code, and maintain a high standard of corporate governance practices of the Company. – 34 – The Company has adopted the Model Code for Securities Transactions by Directors of Listed Issuers (the “Model Code”) as set out in Appendix C3 to the Listing Rules as its own code of conduct regarding Directors’ securities transactions. Having made specific enquiry to all Directors, each of the Directors confirmed that he/she has complied with the required standards as set out in the Model Code during the Reporting Period. PURCHASE, SALE OR REDEMPTION OF THE COMPANY’S LISTED Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has purchased, sold or redeemed any of the Company’s listed securities (including sales of treasury shares) during the Reporting Period. As at June 30, 2024, the Company did not hold any treasury shares. The Company has established the audit committee (the “Audit Committee”), which comprises two independent non-executive Directors, namely Mr. Zhao Hongqiang and Mr. Tang Shun Lam, and one non-executive Director, Mr. Leung Ming Shu. Mr. Zhao Hongqiang is the chairman of the Audit Committee. The primary functions of the Audit Committee are to review and supervise the financial reporting process, internal control and risk management system of the Group, oversee the audit process, provide advice and comments to the Board, perform other duties and responsibilities as may be assigned by the Board, and review and oversee the risk management of the Company. The Audit Committee has discussed with the management of the Company and reviewed the unaudited consolidated interim financial statements of the Group for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and this interim results announcement. – 35 – This interim results announcement is published on the websites of the Stock Exchange (www.hkexnews.hk) and the Company (gogoxholdings.com), and the interim report of the Company for the six months ended June 30, 2024 containing all the information required under the Listing Rules will be dispatched to the shareholders of the Company (if applicable) and published on the respective websites of the Stock Exchange and the Company in due course. On behalf of the Board LAM Hoi Yuen Chairman and Executive Director Hong Kong, August 29, 2024 As at the date of this announcement, the executive Directors are Mr. Lam Hoi Yuen and Mr. He Song; the non- executive Directors are Mr. Leung Ming Shu and Mr. Wang Ye; and the independent non-executive Directors are Mr. Tang Shun Lam, Mr. Zhao Hongqiang and Ms. Norma Ka Yin Chu. – 36 –",

Among the three independent non-executive Directors, Mr. ZHAO Hongqiang has appropriate professional qualifications or accounting or related financial management expertise as required by Rule 3.10(2) of the Listing Rules. The Company has also complied with Rule 3.10A of the Listing Rules relating to the appointment of independent non-executive Directors representing at least one-third of the Board. None of the Directors have any personal relationship (including financial, business, family or other material or relevant relationship) with any other Director and chief executive. All Directors, including independent non-executive Directors, have brought a wide spectrum of valuable business experience, knowledge and professionalism to the Board for its efficient and effective functioning. Independent non-executive Directors are invited to serve on the Audit Committee, the Remuneration Committee and the Nomination Committee. As regards the CG Code provision requiring directors to disclose the number and nature of offices held in public companies or organisations and other significant commitments as well as the identity of the public companies or organisations and the time involved to the issuer, Directors have agreed to disclose their commitments and any subsequent change to the Company in a timely manner. Board Diversity Policy The Board has adopted a board diversity policy (the “Board Diversity Policy”) in order to enhance the effectiveness of our Board and to maintain high standards of corporate governance. The Board Diversity Policy sets out the criteria in selecting candidates to our Board, including but not limited to gender, age, cultural and educational background, ethnicity, professional experience, skills, knowledge and length of service. The ultimate decision will be based on merit and the contribution that the selected candidates will bring to our Board. Under the current composition of our Board, our Board has a balanced mix of knowledge, skills and experience, including experience in e-commerce, finance, corporate management, accounting and financial markets. Our Directors have a diverse educational background including economics, financial accounting, information technology and management. Furthermore, the Board has a wide range of age, ranging from 37 years old to 68 years old. Our Nomination Committee is delegated by our Board to be responsible for compliance with relevant codes governing board diversity under the CG Code. Our Nomination Committee will, from time to time and at least once annually, monitor and evaluate the implementation of the Board Diversity Policy to ensure its continued effectiveness.

To ensure gender diversity of our Board in the long run, the Company will identify and select several female individuals with a diverse range of skills, experience and knowledge in different fields from time to time, and maintain a list of such female individuals, which will be reviewed by the Nomination Committee periodically. The Company also intends to promote gender diversity when recruiting staff at the mid to senior level so that the Company will have a pipeline of female senior management and potential successors to the Board. We plan to offer all-rounded trainings to female employees whom we consider to have the suitable experience, skills and knowledge of our operation and business, including but not limited to, business operation, management, accounting and finance, legal and compliance and research and development. We are of the view that such strategy will offer chances for our Board to identify capable female employees to be nominated as a member of the Board in future. The Nomination Committee and the Board have reviewed the membership, structure and composition of the Board, and are of the opinion that the structure of the Board is reasonable, and the experiences and skills of the Directors in various aspects and fields can enable the Company to maintain high standard of operation. Measurable Objectives As disclosed in the Prospectus, the Company has also taken, and will continue to take steps to promote gender diversity at all levels of the Company, including but without limitation at the Board and the management levels. To enhance gender diversity of the Board, the Company had set a measurable objective at the time of Listing that at least one female Director shall be appointed no later than one year from the Listing Date. Ms. MI Wenjuan has been an independent non-executive Director of the Company and female Director of the Board, the Company has successfully achieved the gender diversity objective. At as December 31, 2023 and up to the date of this annual report, the Nomination Committee and the Board considered an appropriate balance of diversity perspectives of the Board is maintained. For the purpose of implementation of the Board Diversity Policy, the measurable objectives adopted include (a) at least one-third of the members of the Board shall be independent non-executive directors; (b) at least one of the members of the Board shall have obtained accounting or other professional qualifications; and (c) at least one of the members of the Board shall be female. The Board has also assessed the Group’s diversity profile annually of all levels of employees and apply the diversity policy to attract, retain and motivate employees from the widest possible pool of available talent. As of December 31, 2023, the Group had 831 full-time employees (including senior management), of whom the number of female employees (including senior management) accounted for approximately 42.8%. For the purpose of implementation of the gender diversity for the Group’s workforce, the Company plans to hold more trainings on women’s care and childcare, parent-child activities. Based on the Board’s review, there was no mitigating factor or circumstance which makes achieving gender diversity across the workforce (including senior management) more challenging or less relevant.

The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power to direct the activities of the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases. The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for business combinations by the Group (Note 34.2). Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between group companies are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the transferred asset. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group. Non-controlling interests in the results and equity of subsidiaries are shown separately in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated balance sheet respectively.

    "text": "Business combinations The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for all business combinations, regardless of whether equity instruments or other assets are acquired. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary comprises the: • fair values of the assets transferred • liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquired business • equity interests issued by the Group • fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement, and • fair value of any pre-existing equity interest in the subsidiary. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are, with limited exceptions, measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. The Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity on an acquisition-by- acquisition basis either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquired entity’s net identifiable assets. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. The excess of the: • consideration transferred, • amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquired entity, and • acquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquired entity Over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If those amounts are less than the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the business acquired, the difference is recognised directly in profit or loss as a bargain purchase. Where settlement of any part of cash consideration is deferred, the amounts payable in the future are discounted to their present value at the date of exchange. The discount rate used is the entity’s incremental borrowing rate, being the rate at which a similar borrowing could be obtained from an independent financier under comparable terms and conditions. Contingent consideration is classified either as equity or a financial liability. Amounts classified as a financial liability are subsequently remeasured to fair value with changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss. If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date carrying value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date. Any gains or losses arising from such remeasurement are recognised in profit or loss.

(a) Current income tax The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period in the countries where the Company and its subsidiaries operate and generate taxable income. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation and considers whether it is probable that a taxation authority will accept an uncertain tax treatment. The Group measures its tax balances either based on the most likely amount or the expected value, depending on which method provides a better prediction of the resolution of the uncertainty. (b) Deferred income tax Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, deferred tax liabilities are not recognised if they arise from the initial recognition of goodwill. Deferred income tax is also not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled. Deferred tax assets are recognised only if it is probable that future taxable amounts will be available to utilise those temporary differences and losses. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are not recognised for temporary differences between the carrying amount and tax bases of investments in foreign operations where the Company is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities and when the deferred tax balances relate to the same taxation authority. Current tax assets and tax liabilities are offset where the entity has a legally enforceable right to offset and intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. Current and deferred tax is recognised in profit or loss, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.

    "text": "Leases The Group as lessee The Group assesses whether a contract is or contains a lease at inception of a contract. The Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability with respect to all lease agreements in which it is the lessee, except for short-term leases (defined as leases with a lease term of 12 months or less) and leases of low value assets. For these leases, the Group recognises the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, and payments for these leases are presented in the consolidated statement of cash flows from operating activities. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted by using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If this rate cannot be readily determined, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate specific to the lease, e.g. country, term, security and currency of the contract. In addition, the Group considers its recent debt issuances as well as publicly available data for instruments with similar characteristics when calculating the incremental borrowing rates. Lease payments include fixed payments, less any lease incentives, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate known at the commencement date, and purchase options or extension option payments if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise these options. Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or rate are not included in the measurement of the lease liability and right-of-use asset and are recognised as an expense in the profit or loss in the period in which the event or condition that triggers those payments occurs. A lease liability is remeasured upon a change in the lease term, changes in an index or rate used to determine the lease payments or reassessment of exercise of a purchase option. The corresponding adjustment is made to the related right-of-use asset. The right-of-use assets comprise the initial measurement of the corresponding lease liability, lease payments made at or before the commencement date and any initial direct costs. They are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. The right-of-use assets are depreciated starting at the commencement date over the shorter period of useful life of the underlying asset and lease term. The lease liability is presented in the ‘Lease liabilities’ line and the right-of-use assets are presented in the ‘Right-of-use assets’ line in the consolidated balance sheet. In addition, the principal portion of the lease payments and the interest component are presented within financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows. Lease payments are allocated between the principal and finance cost. The finance cost is charged to profit or loss over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period.

In Chinese mainland, we have been pioneering the use of legally compliant NEVs for intra-city logistics services. The Chinese mainland government has introduced policies to promote the use of NEVs in intra-city logistics, and compared with internal combustion engine vehicles, NEVs have fewer restrictions on the passage of urban areas, and enjoy subsidies and other preferential policies. We cooperate with manufacturers of NEVs, assisting drivers to purchase or rent vehicles with discounts, which can increase the share of NEVs available on the platform and contribute to environmental sustainability. In 2022, we facilitated sales of 1,625 NEVs, and 55.2% of orders on our platform in Chinese mainland were fulfilled by NEVs. Specifically, in Shenzhen, the percentage of orders completed by NEVs through our platform increased from 54.7% in January 2021 to 88.5% in December 2022. In the process of expanding its overseas logistics business, GOGOX always adheres to the philosophy of green development and environmental protection, committing to promoting the transformation of the freight logistics industry from traditional transportation to green and new energy freight all over the world. In Singapore and Korea, GOGOX is actively involved in local green transportation activities and collaborates with business organizations.

    "text": "Leases The Group as lessee The Group assesses whether a contract is or contains a lease at inception of a contract. The Group recognises a right- of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability with respect to all lease agreements in which it is the lessee, except for short-term leases (defined as leases with a lease term of 12 months or less) and leases of low value assets. For these leases, the Group recognises the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, and payments for these leases are presented in the consolidated statement of cash flows from operating activities. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted by using the interest rate implicit in the lease. If this rate cannot be readily determined, the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate specific to the lease, e.g. country, term, security and currency of the contract. In addition, the Group considers its recent debt issuances as well as publicly available data for instruments with similar characteristics when calculating the incremental borrowing rates. Lease payments include fixed payments, less any lease incentives, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate known at the commencement date, and purchase options or extension option payments if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise these options. Variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or rate are not included in the measurement of the lease liability and right-of-use asset and are recognised as an expense in the profit or loss in the period in which the event or condition that triggers those payments occurs. A lease liability is remeasured upon a change in the lease term, changes in an index or rate used to determine the lease payments or reassessment of exercise of a purchase option. The corresponding adjustment is made to the related right-of-use asset. The right-of-use assets comprise the initial measurement of the corresponding lease liability, lease payments made at or before the commencement date and any initial direct costs. They are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. The right-of-use assets are depreciated starting at the commencement date over the shorter period of useful life of the underlying asset and lease term. The lease liability is presented in the ‘Lease liabilities’ line and the right-of-use assets are presented in the ‘Right-of-use assets’ line in the consolidated balance sheet. In addition, the principal portion of the lease payments and the interest component are presented within financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows. The Group as lessor Rental income from operating leases where the Group is a lessor is recognised in income on a straight-line basis over the lease term. 164 GOGOX HOLDINGS LIMITED Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements",

For the six months ended June 30, 2022, our total revenue of RMB348.8 million, increased by 15.5% compared to the corresponding period of 2021. Our Service Offerings and Platforms We facilitate and provide intra-city logistics services through our intelligent online platform. Our service offerings consist of platform services, enterprise services as well as a growing range of value-added services, capable of catering to evolving demand of shippers, drivers and other participants in our ecosystem. Platform Services Our platform services digitalize the traditional shipping transaction process and establish a mechanism promoting honest, transparent and efficient dealings among drivers and shippers. Our convenient and efficient platform has attracted millions of shippers, including individuals with logistics needs in their daily life and SMEs with frequent logistics needs during their business operations. Shippers using our platform register on our mobile apps or websites as individual accounts to place orders for intra-city logistics services. Our intelligent matching algorithms will match such shipment orders with drivers based on several factors, including the specification of goods to be delivered, distance and requested vehicle type. Drivers using our platform provide services to satisfy shippers’ diverse needs, ranging from intra-city freight deliveries for bulk goods, same-hour or same-day courier services for lighter items, to household moving services. We help drivers improve their service quality by offering trainings and formulating service standards and procedures. For the six months ended June 30, 2022, we facilitated approximately 10.8 million shipment orders through our platform services, representing a total GTV of approximately RMB894.6 million. 7 2022 INTERIM REPORT Management Discussion and Analysis Enterprise Services Our enterprise services provide scalable intra-city logistics solutions for complex needs. We provide planned and on-demand services for enterprise customers, ranging from SMEs to industry-leading, multinational companies. With our solutions, enterprises with recurring logistics needs can receive standardized services, avoid time-consuming price negotiations and gain better protection from freight damage. We leverage our large base of drivers and provide elastic logistics capacity to address shipment requests that are difficult to forecast. As of June 30, 2022, we had cumulatively served more than 44,900 SMEs and large enterprises through our enterprise services. For the six months ended June 30, 2022, we completed approximately 0.9 million logistics deliveries for our enterprise customers, representing a GTV of approximately RMB218.7 million. Value-added Services We provide a growing range of value-added services for shippers, drivers and other participants in our ecosystem. For example, in mainland China, drivers can access information about locations of fuel stations and vehicle maintenance and repair centers through our mobile apps and book services of their choice at competitive prices. In overseas markets, our value-added services include, among others, fuel cards services in Hong Kong and Singapore and vehicle maintenance and repair services at our proprietary service center in Hong Kong. We believe that our value-added services will increase shippers’ and drivers’ loyalty to and engagement with our platform and diversify our revenue streams. Business Outlook Going forward, the Company will continue to pursue its growth strategies as stated in the Prospectus, including but not limited to, expanding the service network through asset-light model, continuing to broaden the enterprise customer base, strengthening the Group’s technological capacities, growing driver base and increasing driver engagement, exploring diversified monetization opportunities and growing our ecosystem, pursuing strategic partnerships, acquisitions and investments to expand our global footprint. Subject to the market condition and our business performance, we also intend to supplement our service offerings in the future, by cooperating with automobile manufacturers, fleet operators and other cooperators to explore new business line in the provision of car dealership services. Social Responsibility and Corporate Governance We are committed to promoting corporate social responsibility and sustainable development as well as integrating these principles into all major aspects of our business operations. We are always considering corporate social responsibility as part of our core growth philosophy that will be pivotal to our ability to create sustainable value for our shareholders. In mainland China, we are dedicated to promoting the use of NEVs in logistics services which are not only environment- friendly but also legally compliant pursuant to recent regulatory requirements and have implemented internal policies in this regard. In Singapore and Korea, we provide emission-free deliveries with NEVs for certain enterprise customers to facilitate their vision of sustainable expansion. We have also implemented internal policies to reduce our environmental impact and carbon footprint. 8 Management Discussion and Analysis “Customers First, Drivers Oriented” is our motto to operate our business. We aim to achieve growth in a sustainable manner while taking into account the interests of all stakeholders. We build up our competitive advantage to provide technical support, cost-effective and high-quality services to our customers. In addition, we have been striving and will continue to improve the earning flexibility and welfare of drivers. We will continue to excel our corporate governance mechanism, enhance execution and strengthen risk management and internal control, in a bid to providing solid support for the sustainable and healthy development of our Company. Overview For the six months ended June 30, 2022, the Company achieved total revenue of RMB348.8 million, increased by 15.5% compared to the corresponding period of last year. In the same reporting period, gross profit achieved a growth to RMB112.2 million, representing a 5.0% period-to-period increase. The adjusted net loss and adjusted EBITDAi were RMB118.2 million and RMB105.2 million, respectively. The basic and diluted loss per share were RMB269 cents and RMB59 cents, respectively. In the first half of 2022, the Company’s net cash used in operating activities was RMB147.3 million. Capital expenditure was RMB5.0 million as at June 30, 2022. Revenue In the first half of 2022, the Company’s revenue was RMB348.8 million. Despite the negative impact of the COVID-19, our revenue increased by 15.5% from RMB301.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021, mainly due to the organic growth of our enterprise services and value-added services. i. Adjusted net loss represents loss for the period before (i) share-based compensation expenses, (ii) changes in fair value of financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss, and (iii) listing expenses. Adjusted EBITDA represents adjusted net loss for the period before (i) income tax (credit)/expenses, (ii) depreciation and amortization, and (iii) net finance (income)/costs. The Company believes that these items should be adjusted for when calculating our adjusted net loss and adjusted EBITDA in order to provide potential investors with a complete and fair understanding of our operating results, especially in making period-to-period comparisons of, and assessing the profile of, our operating and financial performance, and making comparisons with other comparable companies with similar business operations. 9 2022 INTERIM REPORT Management Discussion and Analysis The following table sets forth a breakdown of our revenue by business line and geographical region in absolute terms of our revenue for the periods indicated. Six months ended June 30, 2022 Six months ended June 30, 2021 (Unaudited) (Unaudited) Period-to-period change Hong Kong Hong Kong Hong Kong PRC and overseas PRC and overseas PRC and overseas operations operations Total operations operations Total operations operations Total RMB’000 RMB’000 RMB’000 RMB’000 RMB’000 RMB’000 RMB’000 RMB’000 RMB’000 Continuing operations Revenue: Logistics services provided to enterprise customers 64,262 150,713 214,975 55,032 118,092 173,124 9,230 32,621 41,851 Service income from logistics services platforms 88,227 22,189 110,416 94,145 22,680 116,825 (5,918) (491) (6,409) Value-added services 11,185 12,179 23,364 3,335 8,588 11,923 7,850 3,591 11,441 Total 163,674 185,081 348,755 152,512 149,360 301,872 11,162 35,721 46,883 Enterprise Services The revenue from enterprise services increased by 24.2% from RMB173.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 to RMB215.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022. Our revenue represents the shipping fares charged by us to enterprises for shipment orders they place with us. The amount we pay for drivers’ delivery services is recorded in our cost of revenue. The increase of the revenue was primarily because (i) our operations in most overseas markets returned to normal as the COVID-19 in these markets had been gradually controlled with the ease of travel restrictions since the beginning of 2022, specifically with strong growth from Korea (+38.1%) and India (+141.2%), (ii) the demand for logistics services from customers in the e-commerce industry continued to increase, and (iii) we continued to gain contracts from new customers across various industries. 10 Management Discussion and Analysis Platform Services The revenue from platform services remained stable, amounting to RMB116.8 million and RMB110.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2022, respectively. We generate revenue from charging service fees to drivers for their use of our platform to provide logistics services for shippers. We cooperated with fleet operators, who use our platform to attract drivers to provide logistics services to shippers. We charged service fee from fleet operators, which was recorded as revenue generated from our value-added services according to our current accounting classification. The platform fleet operators service fee increased by approximately RMB9.4 million for the corresponding periods. Value-added Services Revenue from value-added services increased by 96.6% from RMB11.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 to RMB23.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022. Our value-added services mainly include fuel card services, advertising services, vehicles maintenance and repair services, and referral services, among others. The increase of revenue from value-added services was primarily due to an increase of platform fleet operators service fee of RMB9.4 million, an increase of sales of fuel card services of RMB1.2 million in overseas markets and the organic growth of our business scale. Cost of Revenue Our cost of revenue increased by 21.3% from RMB195.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 to RMB236.5 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, mainly driven by the increase of subcontracting fees of RMB37.0 million, which was in line with the growth of our revenue during the same period. Our cost of revenue excluding share-based compensation expenses increased by 18.9% from RMB195.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 to RMB231.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022. The following table sets forth a breakdown of our cost of revenue (including and excluding the share-based compensation expenses) for the periods indicated.

Excluding the share-based compensation expenses, we recorded (i) a gross profit of RMB106.8 million and RMB116.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2022, respectively, and (ii) a gross profit margin of 35.4% and 33.5% for the same periods, respectively. Our gross profit margin decreased primarily because the growth in our cost of revenue outpaced the growth in our revenue as a result of the increase in subcontracting fees for logistics service providers as our enterprise services experienced a faster growth compared to our platform services. The following table sets forth our gross profit and gross profit margin including and excluding share-based compensation expenses for the periods indicated.

The increase was primarily due to (i) an increase of share-based compensation expenses of RMB31.0 million, (ii) an increase of subcontracting fees for others of RMB16.9 million, mainly outsourced services costs, which was in line with the growth of our revenue and (iii) an increase of promotion and advertising fees of RMB5.7 million. Our selling and marketing expenses excluding share-based compensation expenses increased by 17.3% from RMB116.7 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 to RMB136.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022.

The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of share-based compensation expenses of RMB27.7 million. Our research and development expenses excluding share-based compensation expenses increased by 8.1% from RMB18.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 to RMB19.8 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022.

Other Income Our other income increased by 185.3% from RMB2.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 to RMB6.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, primarily due to the increase of government subsidies in both overseas and mainland China and tax refund received in mainland China. Other Net Losses Our other net losses decreased by 35.5% from RMB1.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 to RMB0.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022 primarily due to foreign currency exchange loss and disposal of fixed assets. 15 2022 INTERIM REPORT Management Discussion and Analysis Operating Loss As a result of the foregoing, our operating loss increased by 690.8% from RMB94.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 to RMB744.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022. Our operating loss excluding share-based compensation expenses and listing expenses increased by 42.1% from RMB85.3 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 to RMB121.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022. Net Finance Income/(Cost) We recorded net finance costs of RMB0.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021, primarily due to the interest expenses on other borrowings from a Group company. We recorded net finance income of RMB1.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, primarily due to the increase in our bank deposits as a result of our financing activities in 2021 and the first half of 2022. Changes in Fair Value of Financial Liabilities at Fair Value Through Profit or Loss We recorded loss in fair value of financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss of RMB150.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and RMB308.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, respectively, primarily due to an increase in the valuation of the Company as the convertible redeemable preferred shares of the Company were automatically converted into the ordinary Shares at the initial public offering price (being HK$21.50 per Share) upon the Listing on June 24, 2022. Income Tax (Credit)/Expenses We had income tax expenses of RMB2.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021, primarily representing the income tax incurred by our profitable subsidiaries. We had income tax credit of RMB2.0 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022, primarily due to the decrease in our current income tax liabilities as the taxable income was nil for the same period. Loss from Discontinued Operation We recorded loss from discontinued operation of RMB18,000 and nil for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and 2022, respectively. Loss from discontinued operation represents the net loss which we recorded for the operations of the now-dissolved subsidiary in Taiwan. Total Comprehensive Loss for the Period Attributable to the Equity Holders of the Company As a result of the foregoing, we generated a loss of RMB246.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2021 and a loss of RMB1,049.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2022. Non-IFRS Measures To supplement this report, which is presented in accordance with IFRSs, we also presented the adjusted net loss and adjusted EBITDA as additional financial measures. The management of the Company believes that the presentation of adjusted net loss (a non-IFRS measure) and adjusted EBITDA (a non-IFRS measure) would facilitate comparisons of operating performance from period to period and comparisons with other comparable companies with similar business operations by eliminating the potential impact of certain items. 16 Management Discussion and Analysis We define adjusted net loss (a non-IFRS measure) as loss for the period adjusted for (i) share-based compensation expenses, (ii) changes in fair value of financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss, and (iii) listing expenses. In the first half of 2022, our adjusted net loss was RMB118.2 million, up by 34.2% compared to the corresponding period of 2021. Share-based compensation expenses consist of non-cash expenses arising from granting options, restricted shares and restricted share units to eligible individuals under the Share Incentive Plan. The convertible redeemable preferred shares have been automatically converted into ordinary Shares upon our Listing on June 24, 2022, and there has been no changes in fair value of financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss since June 24, 2022. We define adjusted EBITDA as adjusted net loss for the period adjusted for (i) income tax (credit)/expenses, (ii) depreciation and amortization, and (iii) net finance (income)/costs. In the first half of 2022, our EBITDA was RMB105.2 million, up by 48.6% compared to the corresponding period of 2021. The following table reconciles our adjusted net loss (a non-IFRS measure) and adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented under IFRS, which is loss for the periods.

The following table provides information regarding our cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021: For the six months ended June 30, 2022 2021 RMB’000 RMB’000 (Unaudited) (Unaudited) Net cash used in operating activities (147,318) (157,562) Net cash (used in)/generated from investing activities (3,644) 1,147 Net cash generated from financing activities 566,305 304,953 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents 415,343 148,538 Cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period 312,997 217,253 Effects of foreign exchange rate changes 20,388 775 Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the period 748,728 366,566 Going forward, we believe that our liquidity requirements will be satisfied by using a combination of cash generated from operating activities and the net proceeds received from the Listing.

We are required under PRC laws to make contributions to employee benefit plans at specific percentages of employee salaries, bonuses and certain allowances of our employees, up to a maximum amount specified by the local government from time to time. We participate in and make contributions to those social security plans and employee benefit plans. The Company also makes payments to other defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans for the benefit of employees employed by subsidiaries outside of the PRC as required by the applicable laws. Our success depends on our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel. As part of our human resources strategy, we offer employees competitive salaries, performance based cash bonuses and other incentives. In order to recognize and acknowledge the contributions made by certain of management members, employees and consultants, the Company has also adopted the Share Incentive Plan on August 18, 2021. We have adopted a training protocol in mainland China, pursuant to which we provide pre-employment and ongoing management and technical training to our employees.

Foreign exchange risk arises when future commercial transactions or recognized assets and liabilities are denominated in a currency that is not the respective functional currency of our subsidiaries. We currently do not hedge transactions undertaken in foreign currencies. Pledge of Assets As of June 30, 2022, restricted cash of RMB95.7 million was pledged, compared with RMB101.5 million as of December 31, 2021. Contingent Liabilities As of June 30, 2022, we did not have any material contingent liabilities or guarantees.

Pursuant to section 342A of the Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance, the SFC may issue, subject to such conditions (if any) as the SFC thinks fit, a certificate of exemption from compliance with the relevant requirements under the Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions) Ordinance if, having regard to the circumstances, the SFC considers that the exemption will not prejudice the interest of the investing public and compliance with any or all of such requirements would be irrelevant or unduly burdensome, or is otherwise unnecessary or inappropriate. A total of 104,134,465 Options had been granted to eligible participants from 2021 to 2022. On January 13, 2022, Mr. Chen exercised the 7,912,383 Options granted to him under the Share Incentive Plan and as a result, 7,912,383 Shares were issued to Genesis Fortune Holdings Limited, a special purpose vehicle indirectly wholly owned by Mr. Chen. In June 2022, due to the departure of certain employees of the Group and a subsidiary of 58 Daojia, 10,982 Options historically granted were cancelled. Accordingly, as of the date of this Prospectus, there are an aggregate of 96,211,100 outstanding and unexercised options granted to 570 grantees, representing the right to subscribe for an aggregate of 96,211,100 Shares.

During the same periods, the average GTV per order for our platform services was RMB94.6, RMB89.6, RMB88.0 and RMB79.9 in mainland China, and RMB109.6, RMB115.2, RMB114.4 and RMB112.3 in overseas markets, respectively. We implement an automated order pricing mechanism to provide transparent pricing for shippers and drivers. In mainland China, shipping fares charged by drivers to shippers are primarily determined taking into account the type of vehicles used, the distance between the pickup and the drop-off location, the number of available drivers, the shipper demand at the time the order is placed, and the prevailing market price in the local logistics market. In overseas markets, we generally provide a fixed fee schedule based on the type of vehicles used and the distance between the pickup and the drop-off location, and shippers can choose to offer drivers extra cash incentives during peak time. We charge service fees to drivers who provide intra-city logistics services by fulfilling shipment orders. Our service fees are either in the form of commission or membership fee. For the shipment orders on which we charge a commission to the driver, the commission is the difference between the amount paid by the shipper and the amount earned by the driver. We have maintained a membership program in mainland China sinceApril 2019. Drivers who use our platform services may choose to subscribe for our memberships which are usually for 30 days or 60 days. During the membership period, we charge no commission on all or part of the shipment orders completed by the drivers, depending on the tier of their memberships. The membership fees we charge vary by locations, and we determine such fees taking into account the competition and the overall wage level in the local markets. We launched our membership program inApril 2019 in selected cities as a pilot scheme and gradually scaled up on a national – 202 – level. In 2019, 2020 and 2021, we had 2,864, 60,559 and 38,202 drivers who participated in our membership program. The number of drivers who participated in our membership program increased from 2,864 in 2019 to 60,559 in 2020 as we only launched the membership program in April 2019 in selected cities and gradually scaled up in 2020. The number of drivers in our membership program decreased to 38,202 in 2021 as we strategically acquired new drivers to register on our platform through fleet operators since 2021, and such new drivers are automatically designated as premium drivers. Drivers registered as premium drivers through fleet operators cannot join the membership program concurrently. Service delivery process The following chart illustrates the key steps of our service delivery process, taking Kuaigou Dache as an example, starting from the registration of shippers and drivers to the settlement of orders.

We may require additional documentation in accordance of applicable laws and regulations and to enhance safety requirements required in different jurisdictions. For more details, see “– Our Commitment to Trust and Safety – Driver Verifications” in this section. (cid:129) Placing orders. Shippers place orders on our platform by filling out information that enables us to efficiently match them with a driver most suitable for the task. Shippers may provide the freight’s location, destination, shipping requirements and type, size and weight of the goods. Based on specifications of goods to be delivered, distance, requested vehicle type and other factors, we provide an estimated shipping fare of an order up front. Our smart pricing capabilities enable us to predict the freightdemandintheregionandproposecompetitivefeequotesthatattractshippers as well as maintain our profit margins. In mainland China, shippers can choose to make deposits in their user accounts or make payments for drivers’ services when the order is completed. In overseas markets, shippers make payments for drivers’ services with cash or through online payment via our platform upon completion of the order. – 203 – Screenshots of the order placement page of our Kuaigou Dache mobile app are set forth below.

We provide planned and on-demand intra-city logistics services for enterprise customers, ranging from SMEs to industry-leading and multinational companies. As of December 31, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021, we had cumulatively served more than 16,000, 21,000, 30,000 and 39,000 SMEs and large enterprises through our enterprise services, respectively. In 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021, we completed approximately 1.1 million, 1.3 million, 1.3 million and 1.6 million logistics deliveries for our enterprise customers, respectively, representing a GTV of approximately RMB316.9 million, RMB305.9 million, RMB301.1 million and RMB375.2 million, respectively. During the same periods, the average GTV per order for our enterprise services was RMB501.3, RMB406.4, RMB339.5 and RMB289.5 in mainland China and RMB151.3, RMB169.4, RMB207.8 and RMB218.2 in overseas markets, respectively. – 206 – We generally enter into framework agreements with our enterprise customers and charge service fees for the logistics services we provide. We rely on drivers on our platform to fulfill the shipment orders for our enterprise services. The framework agreements with enterprise customers typically include the following principal terms: (cid:129) Responsibilities.We will provide logistics services as a freight carrier in accordance with the agreed procedures, while the enterprise customers will pay the agreed fees for the services we provide. (cid:129) Duration. The term of the framework agreements ranges from one to three years. (cid:129) Pricing. We negotiate our service fees on a case-by-case basis, taking into account, among others, the specific services required and the expected order amount from the customer. We typically have a fee schedule in the framework agreements entered into with enterprise customers according to which the service fee for each order is determined, taking into account, among others, the type of vehicles used, the length of time needed for the delivery and the weight of the freight to be delivered.

We are committed to investing in technological innovation and development, and have built reliable, highly automated information technology systems. As of December 31, 2021, we had a research and development team of 123 professionals. Our research and development team consist of engineers who design, develop and implement our system and service offerings, those who maintain our database and develop our data technology including big data analytics, those who focus on improving the operational efficiency of our system, as well as those who focus on cybersecurity and maintain our system infrastructure and stability. We have invested in our computing power to handle usage spikes in demand. We made significant investments in advanced technology, particularly in the areas of big data analytics, machine learning and unmanned driving.We believe that investment in technology will expand our capabilities and optimize our transaction funnel. As of the Latest Practicable Date, we had registered 16 patents and 22 software copyrights with respect to our core technologies and software system. Our Technology Infrastructure Our technology infrastructure possesses the following features: Cloud native. Our platform runs fully in the cloud, which brings scalability and resilience to our services. Relying on cloud-native technologies developed by leading cloud service providers, we are able to reduce costs relating to operating and maintaining physical servers and focus on enhancing our service offerings. Microservices. Our core functional modules are decoupled into a group of microservices, which can evolve independently without having to recompile the underlying platform.Through such architecture, our system achieved high scalability, availability and concurrency. During the Track Record Period, our system honored a 99.9% uptime. Big data. We collect and store user data in strict compliance with applicable laws and regulations and the terms and conditions consented by our users. On such premise, with data analytical tools, we generate valuable insights from analyzing user profiles and transaction records. This allows us to enhance demand prediction, order dispatching and heat map generation. AI. We apply advanced AI technologies, such as reinforcement learning, in a wide range of scenarios, including order matching, intelligent marketing, automatic car-wrap verification, and automatic license plate recognition. Our algorithms are continuously optimized with the input of additional data. – 220 – Our Technological Capabilities Demand prediction. The scale of our network enables us to predict demand and to proactively incentivize driver availability for shippers. This in turn allows us to optimize opportunities for drivers, increasing order frequency and ultimately improving user satisfaction. We use intelligent matching algorithms to track demand and orders in real-time to predict the number of drivers with the capacity or intent to pick up orders during a certain period of time in a day. Smart order dispatching. Our smart dispatching system can analyze the available drivers nearby when a shipper places an order via our platform, and recommend or dispatch the most suitable driver. We also predict the response time of an order so that our operation system may act on potentially long response time orders to increase completion rate of orders on our platform. Automated order pricing. In mainland China, withAI and machine learning technologies, our data-driven algorithms analyze our historical transaction data to automatically determine the appropriate price for an order in a real-time manner. Optimized route recommendations. Our in-house route optimizer provides drivers with bestpossiblerouteforaspecificorder.Toachievethis,wekeeptrackofthereal-timelocations of drivers and the orders they are currently delivering, minimizing deadhead miles. Digitalized driver assessment. We implement an automated evaluation system for drivers based on a number of factors, including ratings provided by shippers, order pickup rate and order completion rate. Drivers with a higher evaluation rating may be dispatched or recommended for orders with higher financial rewards. Risk management. We develop a proprietary risk management system to effectively address credit risks and significantly decrease the risk of fraudulent behaviors. The safety of our shippers and drivers is our priority. We are committed to creating a safe environment during and after each logistics delivery in each market where we operate. Driver Verifications We verify a driver’s documentation including, among others, personal identification, driver’s license and vehicle registration license before the driver could register with our platform. We also require drivers to maintain all mandatory insurance. In mainland China, we also conduct a background check for a driver’s criminal history.After a driver has successfully registered on our platform, we usually conduct follow-up reviews on drivers to ensure their continuing qualification to use our platform. In Hong Kong, we conduct periodic reviews on the status of drivers’license and insurance coverage to ensure their continuous qualification to provide services on our platform. – 221 – Driver Trainings and Assessment We provide our registered drivers with several types of training. All newly registered drivers are required to undergo a series of training programs that cover, among other things, standard of services, policies, and safety standards. In Hong Kong, to ensure the registered drivers fully understand and follow our policies, we send push notifications to our mobile applications to remind drivers to comply with laws, regulations and our policies and provide additional training to those drivers who breach our policies. We are dedicated to improving the quality of services provided by our registered drivers and established protocols to better manage drivers’ behaviors. Our system is able to evaluate the performance of our registered drivers automatically, based on numerous factors, including the performance evaluation provided by shippers, order pickup rate, order completion rate and service quality. Drivers with a higher evaluation rating may be dispatched or recommended for orders with higher financial rewards. Further, we engage human resource agencies and fleet operators to provide drivers to fulfill orders on our platform. These professional entities manage drivers directly and contribute to enhanced service quality. Safety Measures Freight and Personal Safety To promote freight and personal safety, we have in place the following measures: (cid:129) We require new drivers to complete an online safety training and pass a safety test before they can take orders on our platform. (cid:129) We hold online and offline safety education sessions from time to time on topics including freight safety and anti-fraud awareness. (cid:129) The mobile app for drivers in mainland China has a dedicated “Driver’s School” (司 機學堂) section that pushes safety knowledge to drivers from time to time, such as tips on safe driving in bad weather or on mountain roads, to improve their safety awareness. (cid:129) In our terms of use, we prohibit drivers from use our platform to engage in the transportation of dangerous goods identified in government regulations, and require the application of car-wrap to comply with applicable laws and regulations and not to affect safe driving. Words related to hazardous chemicals are blocked on our platform to ban such orders. – 222 – (cid:129) We protect each freight with comprehensive safety features, which enable drivers to make one-button emergency calls to the police and turn on recording protection during the entire route and shippers to track the goods using the real-time tracking function of our platform. Shippers can share the location of their freight while an order is in progress with their friends and families, who can then help them monitor the status of the freight. In mainland China, we also anonymize shippers’ and drivers’ phone number for privacy protection. (cid:129) We maintain adequate insurance coverage for goods and logistics delivered through our platform. In mainland China, we also maintain personal injury insurance while drivers provide logistics services via our platform. (cid:129) We established a procedure to respond to emergent public safety incidents. (cid:129) We adopted policies to restrict maximum driving hours, such as sending push notifications to remind drivers to take a break after a certain period of continuous driving. To further improve safety management, we plan to implement the following initiatives either as our internal policy or as value-added services for drivers on various scale: (cid:129) We will encourage platform drivers to equip their vehicles with auxiliary safety devices and systems to monitor and avoid driving fatigue. We will collaborate with third-party equipment providers to provide such devices and systems to drivers at competitive prices. To motivate drivers to install such equipment, we plan to offer benefits such as priority order dispatch, lower take rate or incentives. We aim at a 80% completion rate by the end of 2023. (cid:129) We will continue to prohibit drivers who caused material accidents and complaints from taking orders on our platform. (cid:129) We plan to include safe driving as one of the assessment criteria for drivers by July 2022. We currently maintain insurance coverage for freight and goods delivered through our platformandpersonalinjuryinsurancewhiledriversprovidelogisticsservicesviaourplatform in mainland China. We are exploring the option to purchase additional commercial insurance, such as insurance for critical illness and work absence, for platform drivers who use our platform as their main source of revenue. We do not expect that the implementation of the foregoing measures will materially affect our operations and financial performance in the future. – 223 – Feedback Mechanism Our platform has a feedback mechanism which enables shippers to make ratings for drivers who fulfill the shipment orders and submit instant and anonymous feedback on their experience with our platform in a majority of the markets in which we operate. If a driver’s rating falls below average, our user service department will contact the driver to address the issue. In mainland China, when dispatching orders, we give priority to drivers with a higher rating. Depending on the nature of the feedback received, a driver may be blocked from accepting shipments for a certain period of time. The feedback mechanism is bilateral. If a shipper has acted against our policies, the shipper will be required to place order with prepayment or they will not be able to place orders on our platform for a certain period of time or permanently. Complaint Handling We are committed to address user complaints in a prompt and fair manner. Our users can submit an inquiry or complaint through our mobile apps or by calling our user service hotline. We have established complaint handling policies and we have a dedicated user service center in mainland China and user service teams in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Korea, to be responsible for handling user inquiries, solving complaints and improving the overall user satisfaction of our platform. We impose in our terms of use a general obligation on drivers to comply with all applicable laws and regulations when performing services through our platform. Where violations of laws and regulations by drivers come to our knowledge through user complaints or otherwise, we take further action to actively discourage any such behavior, such as through push notifications on our mobile applications to highlight the associated risks and penalties. After due investigation, we may mandate drivers to participate in additional training or ban them from using our platform. In mainland China, we also proactively monitor the conduct of platform drivers. Our system continuously monitors whether drivers are not on the assigned route, driving too fast ortooslow,whetherthephotossubmittedbydriversrecordingtheuploadandunloadoffreight are abnormal, and whether there are other abnormal situations. Based on the specific situation, our customer service department will follow up with any abnormal incidents identified. In overseas markets, we monitor drivers for compliance with laws and regulations on a post-event basis.To the extent there are irregularities which trigger a complaint or feedback, the customer service team or driver management team will take appropriate action to investigate and resolve such issues. COVID-19 Prevention Measures We take a variety of measures in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. All drivers registered on our platform are required to wear masks, and adhere to personal hygiene protocols, such as sanitization before each logistics delivery. In addition, the Hong Kong government contracted us to collect COVID-19 testing samples from persons under mandatory quarantine, aiding in its efforts in combatting the COVID-19 pandemic. – 224 – Data Privacy and Data Protection We are committed to the protection of data privacy and data security and have implemented a comprehensive set of internal policies on network security, data security, data backup and recovery, data protection, security emergency plan, and information security incident management. In order to effectively provide our services, we may collect and use basic user data. This informationincludes,fromtheshipper,thepickuplocation,destinationaddress,phonenumber, andrelevantinformationoftheshippedgoods,and,fromthedriver,vehicleinformation,phone number, driver’s license and bank account information. We only collect the personal information and data necessary for the use of our platform. Our data usage and privacy policy, which is provided to every user of our mobile apps, websites or, for mainland China, our WeChat mini-app, describes our data practices. Specifically, we undertake to manage and use the data collected from users in accordance with applicable laws and make reasonable efforts to prevent the unauthorized access, breach, tampering or loss of personal information. In mainland China, drivers and shippers would use cryptographic number to communicate via our platform. We will desensitize important data with encryption, masking or replacement techniques. In addition, we have provided users the option to clear their data on our platform. We collect and use personal data for the stated purpose as authorized by the user, or with other legal bases as provided by laws and regulations. We do not share with, transfer or disclose personal data to any third-parties except for certain limited circumstances, including when it is expressly authorized by our users, necessary to fulfill our main services to our users, or in compliance with the applicable laws and regulations. We use a variety of technologies to protect the data with which we are entrusted in providing all of our solutions. For example, we utilize a system of firewalls and maintain a perimeter network to segregate our internal databases and operating systems from our external-facing services and intercept unauthorized access. In accordance with our data privacy and data security policy, we strictly limit our employees’ access to personal information and data of our registered users. We require any access to or processing of personal information to undergo strict assessment and approval procedures, and all relevant personnel must sign confidentiality agreements. In mainland China, we classify the data we collect into two categories: sensitive data (including phone numbers and ID numbers of shippers and drivers) and other non-sensitive data. To access any sensitive data, employees are required to submit for approvals from our co-chief executive officers and explain the purpose and necessity of the request. In overseas markets, authorization of data access is granted to authorized personnel of specific job functions. Any request to access data beyond the pre-approved scope of authorization needs approval by a – 225 – director-level staff or equivalent at the relevant local operating entity or his or her superiors. In addition, no department or individual in our Group may directly publish sensitive personal information such as ID numbers, telephone numbers of both drivers and shippers or addresses of departure and destination of each shipment order. Furthermore, we enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees who have access to user information. The confidentiality agreements provide that, among others, our employees are legally obligated not to share, distribute or sell confidential information, including user information in their possession, to any party, including other employees who otherwise have no access to the information. We provide regular data privacy and security trainings. Our employees are also legally obligated to surrender all confidential information in possession upon resignation, and to retain their confidential obligations thereafter. Our employees bear compensation liability upon a breach of their confidentiality obligations or if they otherwise commit misconduct resulting in a leakage of confidential information. In mainland China, we have established a specialized cybersecurity department to formulate data protection strategy, assess data security risk, oversee data security matters and monitor data access and processing activities. Our internal audit and supervision department is designated to supervise the execution of our data security policies. In addition, we have engaged legal advisors to provide trainings relating to data privacy and protection and conduct compliancereviewtofurtherimproveourcompliancepoliciesandmeasuresinconnectionwith data privacy and protection. In overseas markets, we have designated specialized personnel in our technology team to implement and oversee data security policies. We will closely oversee the implementation of relevant policies and measures and monitor future regulatory developments. During the Track Record Period and up to the Latest Practicable Date, we had not received any claim from any third party against us on the ground of infringement of such party’s right to data protection as provided by the any applicable laws and regulations in the jurisdictions we operate. Infrastructure Stability We have implemented a variety of protocols and procedures, such as regular system checks, password policy, server access logging, network access authentication, user authorization review and approval and data back-up, as well as data recovery test, to safeguard our data assets and prevent unauthorized access to our network. We have policies to provide response plans to deal with incidents related to data security. Our operation and maintenance team and data security team monitors the operation of our systems and conduct safety drill on a regular basis. We have installed genuine anti-virus software and firewalls into our computer database storing the personal information of our users and update the system regularly as needed. We also maintain a backup of our operating data to minimize the risk of data loss. In – 226 – mainlandChina,oursystemisaccreditedtheMulti-LayerProtectionScheme(MLPS)LevelIII Certification (“信息系統安全等級保護三級”) awarded by the local branch of the Ministry of Public Security of the PRC, which endorses our capability in system operation and information security. We continue to improve and enhance our data and system security through routine checks and periodic upgrades to ensure the proper management of our operational data. Whenever an issue is discovered, we take prompt actions to upgrade our system and mitigate any potential problems that may undermine the security of our system. We believe our policies and practice with respect to data privacy and security are in compliance with applicable laws and with prevalent industry practice.

    "text": "million, 33.4 million, 27.1 million and 28.4 million shipment orders on our platform with GTV of RMB3,356.9 million, RMB3,313.0 million, RMB2,694.4 million and RMB2,676.7 million, respectively. The continued growth of shippers and enterprise users on our platform relies on, among other things, our abilities to maintain a high success rate of matching on-demand freight orders, to provide quality solutions, as well as our abilities to enter new cities and increase the penetration rate of our services in the cities where we operate. To enter into new cities and grow our user base, we will recruit dedicated local teams and personnel, conduct pre-stage market surveys, make online and offline brand exposure campaigns and use incentives to attract and retain shippers and drivers. Our expected investment cost in setting up operations in a new city in mainland China varies depending on the operational scale, and the initial setup process typically takes two months. We estimate that establishing operations in a new city in mainland China, which generate a daily average of 1,000 shipment orders, would usually require an investment ranging from approximately RMB0.9 million to RMB1.2 million during the first two months. During the Track Record Period, selling and marketing expenses were the largest componentofouroperatingexpenses.In2018,weinvestedheavilyinourmarketinginitiatives toexpandouruserbaseandincurredsellingandmarketingexpensesofRMB524.1million.We reduced our selling and marketing expenses by 43.5% to RMB296.0 million in 2019, and further by 34.2% to RMB194.8 million in 2020 as a result of our efforts on cost control while maintaining growth in business scale and user base. In 2021, we increased our sales and marketing efforts, including offering incentives to shippers to retain and attract these users of our platform services reflecting a more aggressive growth strategy and the intensified competition in the online intra-city logistics market in mainland China. Our incentives to transacting users from platform services increased to RMB166.5 million in 2021 from RMB27.5 million in 2020, which contributed to an increase in our selling and marketing expenses to RMB335.0 million in 2021 compared to RMB194.8 million in 2020. We will strategically adjust our marketing approaches based on the market competition and our business performance and needs from time to time. We may invest significantly in business expansion in the future, which could affect our profitability. – 384 – Our ability to optimize the prices of our services DuringtheTrackRecordPeriod,wegeneratedrevenueprimarilyfromenterpriseservices, platform services and value-added services. Our ability to optimize the service fees that we charge our customers for our services directly affect our results of operations and profitability. Enterprise services. We provide planned and on-demand logistics services for enterprise customers. The service fee earned by us is the total amount paid by enterprise customers for shipment orders they place with us. We negotiate our service fees on a case-by-case basis. The primary factors that affect the service fees we charge include the type of vehicles used, pre-planned or ad-hoc delivery schedule, the length of time required for the delivery and the weight of the freight, as well as the service fees to be paid to drivers who fulfill the shipment orders. Platform services. We facilitate on-demand intra-city logistics transactions by matching shippers with drivers on our platform. We charge service fees from drivers who provide intra-city logistics services by fulfilling shipment orders either in the form of commission or membership fee. For the shipment orders on which we charge a commission to the driver, the commission is the difference between the amount paid by the shipper and the amount earned by the driver. We have maintained a membership program in mainland China sinceApril 2019. Drivers who use our platform services may choose to subscribe for our memberships which are usually for 30 days or 60 days. During the membership period, we charge no commission on all or part of the shipment orders completed by the drivers, depending on the tier of their memberships. The pricing of our platform services is affected by several factors, including the distance between the pickup and the drop-off location, the number of available drivers, the number of shipment orders placed by shippers on our platform, the regulatory requirements and policies, as well as the competition and the prevailing market price in the local logistics market. We measure our pricing for the platform services by the average take rate in a given period, calculated by dividing the revenue generated from our platform services by the total GTV of shipment orders fulfilled in a given period. Our average take rate in mainland China was 5.8%, 8.2%, 9.8% and 12.0% in 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively. Our average take rate in overseas markets was 4.5%, 6.8%, 8.2% and 9.2% in 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively. Our ability to maintain or increase the pricing of our enterprise services and platform services will largely depend on our ability to compete effectively and differentiate our services throughourstrongbrandrecognition,ouruniqueandnationwidedrivernetworkandourability to meet ever-evolving needs for logistics services. – 385 – Our ability to diversify our monetization channels Our revenue and results of operations are affected by our ability to monetize our services. For our enterprise services, we provide planned and on-demand intra-city logistics solutions for enterprise customers and charge them fees for logistics services. For our platform services, we facilitate on-demand freight deliveries by matching shippers with drivers on our platform and charge service fees from drivers who fulfill freight delivery services. In addition, we have expanded and plan to further expand our service offering into new service categories. For example, in mainland China, we also cooperate with manufacturers of NEVs, assisting drivers to purchase or rent vehicles with competitive prices, which are in line with the trend of purchasing NEVs and environmental sustainability. We provide drivers with access to information about fuel stations or vehicle maintenance and repair centers such as locations, fuelorserviceprices,andenablethemtobooktherefuelingormaintenanceandrepairservices through our mobile app. In overseas markets, our value-added services include, among others, fuel card services in Hong Kong and Singapore and vehicle maintenance and repair services at our proprietary service center in Hong Kong. Furthermore, our ability to continue to step up our monetization efforts in Asia and explore additional types of service charges is a key factor affecting the revenue generated from enterprise services and platform services. We intend to further capture monetization opportunities along the value chain of the logistics market in mainland China, such as launching new energy vehicle rental services. We will continue to operate under an asset-light business model, while covering other logistics components valued by SMEs such as warehousing, inventory management, e-commerce integration, picking and packing, and reverse logistics, through collaboration with third parties. Our monetization initiatives may require us to devote significant financial and managerial resources and may not perform as expected due to a variety of factors beyond our control. In addition, as we monitor market developments, we may adjust our monetization strategies from time to time, which could result in decreases of our total revenue or revenue contributions from certain monetization channels. Our ability to manage costs and expenses Our ability to increase our profitability is dependent on whether we can effectively manage our cost and expenses and improve operational efficiency. Our cost of revenue was RMB348.8 million, RMB375.4 million, RMB347.0 million and RMB419.1 million in 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021, representing 77.0%, 68.4%, 65.4% and 63.4% of our total revenue in the same periods, respectively. During the Track Record Period, subcontracting fees for logistics service providers in connection with our enterprise services were the largest component of our cost of revenue. It represents the service fees that we paid for drivers’services through the human resources agencies and operators of vehicle fleets who retain individual drivers as their independent contractors. – 386 – Our selling and marketing expenses were RMB524.1 million, RMB296.0 million, RMB194.8 million and RMB335.0 million in 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively. Our selling and marketing expenses in 2018 were higher than those in 2019 and 2020 primarily because we invested a significant amount in advertising and promotion campaigns and offered incentivesforindividualshipperstopromoteourbrandnameintheearlystageofourbusiness. We reduced advertising expenses in 2019 and 2020 attributable to our strengthened brand awareness and word-of-mouth referrals of our platform among users. Our selling and marketing expenses increased to RMB335.0 million in 2021 compared to RMB194.8 million in 2020, primarily due to a significant increase in incentives that we offered transacting users of platform services reflecting a more aggressive growth strategy and the intensified competition in the online intra-city logistics market in mainland China. Our results of operations and long-term growth prospects will also depend on our ability to develop our platform and the underlying technologies. Over the years, we have used significant resources in technology and internal support functions which enable us to match drivers for shipment orders more efficiently. We believe the growth in our business scale and synergies across our on-demand service and planned service can help us better manage costs and expenses and improve operational efficiency. IMPACT OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC TheoutbreakofCOVID-19severelyimpactedmainlandChinain2020.Inanefforttohalt the outbreak, the PRC government placed significant restrictions on travel within mainland China and closed certain businesses, and governments of other countries and regions also halted or sharply curtailed the movement of people, goods and services to and from mainland China. Moreover, the COVID-19 outbreak has become a global pandemic and affected regions outside of mainland China, including other countries and regions inAsia in which we operate. We experienced certain disruptions in our operations as a result of the government- imposed restrictions on travel and social gathering, quarantines and shutdowns due to the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020. A substantial number of our offices in mainland China were closed in February of 2020. In addition, the COVID-19 outbreak materially and adversely affected the operations of many enterprises, resulting in significant declines in demand for our services. The intra-city logistics industry was particularly impacted. The business activities of some of our major user groups, such as wholesale market merchants, supermarkets and restaurants, were severely affected. We also experienced significant declines in the number of driversavailabletoprovideservicesduetoquarantinesandmobilityrestrictionsinurbanareas. In contrast, according to Frost & Sullivan, players in the inter-city logistics industry were less impacted as much-needed medical supplies and consumer goods were still being transported betweeninter-cityhighways.Accordingtothesamesource,playersinonlinefooddeliveryand express delivery industries experienced increased business demand as restaurants and retailers were temporarily closed. As a result of the intensified competition, our total GTV generated – 387 – in mainland China decreased from RMB1,197.0 million in the first half of 2019 to RMB794.1 million in the first half of 2020, and the number of shipment orders generated in mainland China decreased from 12.4 million in the first half of 2019 to 8.7 million in the first half of 2020. TheCOVID-19pandemicadverselyimpactedourbusinessoperationsinoverseasmarkets as well. The local governments of Hong Kong and other foreign countries and regions began to impose epidemic prevention and control measures as the COVID-19 pandemic escalated in the middle of 2020, such as compulsory “work from home” policies and closure of factories and offices in certain areas. Such measures resulted in reduced commercial activities of enterprises and individuals, which in turn affected demands for our enterprise services and platform services in certain markets. Our total GTV generated in overseas markets decreased from RMB351.2 million in the first half of 2019 to RMB326.9 million in the first half of 2020, and the number of shipment orders generated in overseas markets decreased from approximately 3.0 million in the first half of 2019 to approximately 2.5 million in the first half of 2020. We undertook a series of mitigating actions to alleviate the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on our business. To ease our cash flow burdens, we carefully controlled our administrative expenses and temporarily adjusted compensation for management staff. In addition, we received government subsidies and enjoyed favorable policies as governmental efforts to ease the burden of businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. For the period from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2021, the total amount of government subsidies and payment reductions or exemptions we were benefited in connection with the COVID-19 outbreak were approximately RMB16.0 million in mainland China and RMB11.7 million in overseas markets. For example, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security of the PRC, the MOF and the State Taxation Administration temporarily reduced or exempted paymentsofourcontributionstothestatutoryemployeesocialsecurityplansinFebruary2020. We also received the anti-epidemic fund granted by the Hong Kong and Singapore governments. Since the second quarter of 2020, many of the quarantine measures within mainland China have been relaxed, though from time to time, restrictions were re-imposed in certain cities during the third and fourth quarters of 2020. Although the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in Hong Kong and other foreign countries and regions have been gradually controlled in 2021, sporadic resurgence of the pandemic happened in certain markets where we operate, such as Hong Kong, Korea and Singapore. As our business gradually recovered from the impact of COVID-19 pandemic, our revenue increased by RMB80.6 million, or 35.8%, from RMB224.9 million in the first half of 2020 to RMB305.5 million in the second half of 2020, and our gross profit increased by RMB48.4 million, or 71.7%, from RMB67.5 million to RMB115.9 million, representing a gross margin of 30.0% and 37.9% in the same periods, respectively. Our revenue in 2021 amounted to RMB660.9 million, representing an increase by RMB130.5 million, or 24.6%, from RMB530.4 million in 2020. Our gross profit increased by RMB58.3 million, or 31.8% from RMB183.4 million in 2020 to RMB241.7 million in 2021, and our gross profit margin increased from 34.6% in 2020 to – 388 – 36.6% in 2021. Our business achieved steady growth in 2021. Our revenue increased by RMB57.1 million, or 18.9%, from RMB301.9 million in the first half of 2021 to RMB359.0 million in the second half of 2021, while our gross profit increased by RMB28.0 million, or 26.2%, from RMB106.8 million to RMB134.9 million, representing a gross margin of 35.4% and 37.6% in the two periods, respectively. As of the Latest Practicable Date, an outbreak of the Omicron (COVID-19 variant) in mainland China and globally since the beginning of 2022 had again caused more stringent measures, including temporary lock-down, implemented in certain cities in mainland China. Consequently, our GTV generated from certain cities in the regional outbreak decreased significantly. In addition, our business in Hong Kong was negatively impacted by the resurgence of COVID-19 variant, resulting in decreases in the number of completed orders and GTVin March 2022, and gradually recovered sinceApril 2022.We have not been aggressively expanding into new markets in 2022 considering the on-going effect of the resurgence of COVID-19. We pay close attention to the development of COVID-19 and its impact on our businessoperationsandfinancialperformance.However,wecurrentlyareunabletopredictthe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and operations, our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and liquidity in the future, as these depend on rapidly evolving developments, which are highly uncertain and will be a function of factors beyond our control. Such factors include, among others, the continued spread or recurrence of infection, the implementation of effective preventative and containment measures, the development of effective medical solutions, and the extent to which governmental restrictions on travel, public gatherings, mobility and other activities remain in place or are augmented. See “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Business and Industry – Our business operations and financial performance have been adversely affected by the COVID-19 outbreak, may in the future continue to be affected by the COVID-19 outbreak, and may be affected by other epidemics.” Our significant accounting policies, which are important for understanding our financial condition and results of operations, are set forth in Note 2 to the Accountant’s Report in AppendixItothisprospectus.Someofouraccountingpoliciesinvolvesubjectiveassumptions, estimates and judgements that are set forth in Note 4 to the Accountant’s Report in Appendix I to this prospectus. In each case, the determination of these items requires management judgment based on information and financial data that may change in future periods. When reviewing our financial statements, you should consider (i) our selection of significant accounting policies, (ii) the judgments and other uncertainties affecting the application of such policies, and (iii) the sensitivity of reported results to changes in conditions and assumptions. – 389 – Revenue Recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sales of goods or services in the ordinary course of our activities. We are a principal if we control the specified goods or services before that goods or services are transferred to a customer. We are an agent if our performance obligation is to arrange for the provision of the specified goods or services by another party. In such case, we do not control the specified goods or services provided by another party before that goods or services are transferred to the customer. When we act as an agent, we recognize revenue in the amount of any fee or commission to which we expect to receive for arranging for the specified goods or services to be provided by the other party. Revenue is recognized when or as the control of the goods or services is transferred to the customer. Depending on the terms of the contract and the laws that apply to the contract, control of the goods or services may be transferred over time or at a point in time. If control of the goods or services transfer over time, revenue is recognized over the period of the contract by reference to the progress towards complete satisfaction of that performance obligation. Otherwise, revenue is recognized at a point in time when the customer obtains control of the goods or services. Enterprise services We provide planned and on-demand intra-city logistics services for enterprise customers. As a freight carrier, we usually enter into logistics services agreements with enterprises and fulfill shipment orders by matching them with drivers registered on our platform. Enterprise customers can place orders for logistics services through our online platform or through our websites, mobile apps or other means. We conclude that we act as a principal in the provision of logistics services as we are primarily responsible for the logistics and delivery services which meet the service specifications agreed upon with the enterprise customers. We have the ability to control the logistics services because (i) with our smart dispatching system, we identify and direct drivers registered on our platform to fulfill the shipment orders, and (ii) we have full discretion in establishing services fee rates for our services to enterprise customers. The service fee earned by us is the total amount paid by the enterprise customers for all shipment orders they place with us. Revenue generated from our enterprise services are recognized on a gross basis over the period when the service is rendered. The amounts that we paid to drivers are recorded in cost of revenue. Platform services We provide a service to drivers to complete logistics service for shippers. Our service assists the drivers to find, receive and fulfill on-demand requests from shippers seeking logistics services, using our online platform. – 390 – We conclude that we act as an agent in the provision of platform services as we are not responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the logistics services provided by drivers, nor do we have the ability to control the related services. We charge service fees to drivers who provide intra-city logistics services by fulfilling shipment orders either in the form of commission or membership fee and we regard drivers as customers of our platform services. For orders where a commission is charged, upon the completion of shipment order, we recognize the service fees charged to the drivers. The amounts to be remitted to drivers from the cash payments made by shippers, after netting of the service fees that we charge to drivers, are recorded as payables to drivers. In case we charge a fixed amount of membership fees to driversfortheiruseofourplatformoveracertainperiodoftime,werecognizethemembership fees on a straight-line basis over the usage period. Value-added services Value-added services comprise primarily revenue generated from provision of fuel cards services and cargo compensation facilitation services. We determine we act as an intermediary to bring both parties together but not the primary contracting parties of these transactions. We recognize revenue on a net basis at point in time when the respective services are rendered. We had rental income from vehicle rental business during theTrack Record Period. Lease income from operating leases where we are a lessor is recognized in income on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Incentives Incentives to customers For our enterprise services, we regard the enterprises that enter into logistics services agreements with us as our customers. Our incentives to enterprise customers were approximately RMB0.09 million, RMB0.4 million, RMB0.8 million and RMB1.7 million in 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively. We record incentives to our enterprise customers as deduction of revenue, to the extent of the revenue collected from the customers. For our platform services, we regard the drivers, who are matched with shipment orders through our platform and complete the shipment orders, as our customers. Our incentives to drivers were approximately RMB92.1 million, RMB33.0 million, RMB17.5 million and RMB16.3 million in 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively. We record incentive to drivers, who are the customers of our platform services, as deduction of revenue, to the extent of the revenue collected from the customers. Incentives to transacting users of platform services The substantial services to shippers, being the transacting users who use our platform, are provided by the drivers registered on our platform who are third parties. The incentives are offeredtoshippersatourdiscretioninordertoretainshippersonourplatform.Therefore,such incentives are recorded as our selling and marketing expenses. Our incentives to transacting users were RMB98.1 million, RMB38.0 million, RMB27.5 million and RMB166.5 million in 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively. – 391 – Incentives to service providers of logistics and delivery services For our enterprise services, we enter into agreements with enterprises and are responsible for providing logistics and delivery services. We enter into agreements with human resource agencies and fleet operators pursuant to which these vendors send drivers to our platform to fulfill shipment orders. The incentives we offer to these drivers, who provide logistics and delivery services for our enterprise services business, are recognized as cost of revenue as they are part of our fulfillment costs for completion of our performance obligation under our agreements with enterprise customers. Our incentives to these drivers were approximately RMB1.0 million, RMB1.1 million, RMB1.6 million and RMB3.1 million in 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively. We have formulated different criteria of offering incentives to each category of abovementioned customers, transacting users of platform services and services providers of logistics and delivery services to attract and retain them. Our criteria take into consideration various factors, including but not limited to (i) the frequency of orders, (ii) whether they are new users to our platform, and (iii) the length of time since the last order placement. We also adjust the strategies for offering incentives based on the market competition to maintain our competitive edge. The following table sets forth the range of incentives that we offered and average incentive per order during the Track Record Period.

(2) Calculated by dividing the total amount of incentives that were offered to the specified type of parties inagivenperiodbythetotalnumberofshipmentordersforenterpriseservicesorplatformservices(as the case may be) during the same period. – 392 – In 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021, the aggregate amount of incentives for our enterprise services amounted to approximately RMB1.1 million, RMB1.4 million, RMB2.4 million and RMB4.7 million, respectively, representing 0.3%, 0.5%, 0.8% and 1.3% of the GTV of our enterprise services in the same periods, respectively. In 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021, the aggregate amount of incentives for our platform services amounted to approximately RMB190.2 million, RMB71.0 million, RMB45.0 million and RMB182.8 million, respectively, representing 6.3%, 2.4%, 1.9% and 7.9% of the GTV of our platform services in the same periods, respectively. We offered a significant amount of incentives to transacting users and drivers on our platform in 2018, primarily due to (i) our strategytoacquireshippersanddriversandimprovetheirstickinesstoourre-brandedplatform afterourmergerwithGoGoVanCaymanin2017,and(ii)oureffortstoincreaseourpenetration in the markets where we operate. The aggregate amount of incentives to transacting users and drivers decreased, in both absolute terms and as a percentage of our GTV of platform services, from 2018 to 2019, primarily due to (i) our strengthened brand awareness in certain markets, and (ii) our adjusted strategy to focus on service quality rather than growth of scale. The aggregate amount of incentives to transacting users and drivers continued to decrease, in both absolute terms and as a percentage of our GTV of platform services, from 2019 to 2020, primarily due to our strengthened brand awareness in the markets where we operate. The increaseintheaggregateamountofincentivestotransactingusersanddrivers,inbothabsolute terms and as a percentage of our GTV of platform services, from 2020 to 2021 primarily reflected our efforts to attract transacting users of platform services reflecting a more aggressive growth strategy and the intensified competition in the online intra-city logistics market in mainland China as a major mobility technology platform started its freight services in June 2020 and further entered into more cities in April 2021, some of which are our key regional markets, such as Beijing and Hefei. Impairment of Non-financial Assets Goodwill and intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortization and are tested annually for impairment, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that they might be impaired. Other assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. For the purpose of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash inflows which are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets (cash- generating units). Non-financial assets other than goodwill that suffered an impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment at the end of each reporting period. – 393 – Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill Goodwill is not amortized but it is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if eventsorchangesincircumstancesindicatethatitmightbeimpaired,andiscarriedatcostless accumulated impairment losses, if any. Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold. Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing. The allocation is made to those cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose. The units or groups of units are identified at the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes, being the operating segments. Brand name Brandnameacquiredinabusinesscombinationarerecognizedatfairvalueonacquisition date. They have a finite useful life and are subsequently carried at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment losses, if any. Other intangible assets Other intangible assets mainly include service platform, customer relationship and computer software. They are initially recognized and measured at cost or fair value of intangible assets acquired through business combination. They have a finite useful life and are subsequently carried at cost less accumulated amortization and impairment losses, if any. Amortization methods and periods We amortize these intangible assets with a limited useful life using the straight-line method over the following periods: Computer software Three to ten years Service platform Three years Brand name Ten years Customer relationship Six years When determining the length of useful lives of these intangible assets, management take into account the (i) estimated period during which such asset can bring economic benefits to us; and (ii) the useful life estimated by comparable companies in the market. – 394 – Research and development Researchexpenditureanddevelopmentexpenditurethatdonotmeetthefollowingcriteria are recognized as an expense as incurred: (cid:129) it is technically feasible to complete the intangible asset so that it will be available for use; (cid:129) management intends to complete the software and use or sell it; (cid:129) there is an ability to use or sell intangible asset; (cid:129) it can be demonstrated how the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits; (cid:129) adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the intangible asset are available; and (cid:129) the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development can be reliably measured. Development costs previously recognized as an expense are not recognized as an asset in a subsequent period. Equity-settled Share-based Payments Equity-settled share-based compensation relating to 58 Daojia and GoGoVan Cayman Share-basedcompensationtoouremployeesandconsultantsprovidingsimilarservicesas employee are granted under a share incentive plan of 58 Daojia, our parent company, and non-controlling interest in GoGoVan Cayman (“Investor’s Incentive Plan”). The investors grant their share options to our eligible employees and consultants. We have no obligation to settle the share-based payment transactions and measures the services received as an equity-settled share-based payment transaction. In terms of the share options awarded to employees, the total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of options granted: (cid:129) including any market performance conditions; (cid:129) excludingtheimpactofanyserviceandnon-marketperformancevestingconditions; and (cid:129) including the impact of any non-vesting conditions. – 395 – Non-marketing performance and service conditions are included in calculation of the number of share options that are expected to vest. The total amount expensed is recognized over the vesting period, which is the period over which all of the specified vesting conditions are to be satisfied. At the end of each reporting period, we revise our estimates of the number of share options that are expected to vest based on the non-marketing performance and service conditions. We recognize the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the combined statement of comprehensive income, with a corresponding adjustment to equity. In some circumstances, employees may provide services in advance of the grant date and therefore the grant date fair value is estimated for the purposes of recognizing the expense during the period between service commencement period and grant date. Share-based awards relating to Daojia Limited Daojia Limited, of which 58 Daojia is a principal shareholder, operates a share-based compensation plan which covers our certain employees. We have no obligation to settle the share-based payment transaction but also apply the principles of IFRS 2 to measure the service received as an equity-settled share-based payment transaction. Equity-settled share-based compensation relating to the Company We operate the Share Incentive Plan, under which we either (i) receive services from directors, employee and consultants providing similar services as employee in exchange for equity instruments of our Company or (ii) grant share options to other individuals under 58 Daojia or Daojia Limited. The fair value of options granted to directors, employee and consultants providing similar services as employee under the Share Incentive Plan is recognised as expenses over the requisite service period, with a corresponding increase in equity. The total amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted on grant date: (cid:129) including any market performance conditions; (cid:129) excludingtheimpactofanyserviceandnon-marketperformancevestingconditions; and (cid:129) including the impact of any non-vesting conditions. The total expense is recognised over the vesting period, which is the period over which all of the specified vesting conditions are to be satisfied. At the end of each period, we revise our estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest based on the non-market vesting and service conditions. We recognise the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in profit or loss, with a corresponding adjustment to equity. The fair value of options granted to other individuals under 58 Daojia or Daojia Limited where we have obligation to settle is recognised as a deemed distribution to shareholders over the vesting period with a corresponding increase in equity in accordance with IFRS 2. – 396 – Modification We may modify the terms and conditions on which share incentive awards were granted. If a modification increases the fair value of the equity instruments granted, the incremental fair value granted is included in the measurement of the amount recognized for the services received over the remaining of the vesting period. Other share-based payments Cash-settled share-based payments transactions are measured at the fair value of the goods or services received, except where that fair value cannot be estimated reliably, in which case they are measured at the fair value of the financial instrument granted. The share-based payments are recognized as expenses in accordance with IFRS 2, “Share-based payment” unless the goods or services qualify for recognition as assets. Discontinued Operation A discontinued operation is a component of the entity that has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale and that represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations, is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of such a line of business or area of operations, or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale. The results of discontinued operations are presented separately in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. The preparation of our historical financial information requires the use of accounting estimates which, by definition, will seldom equal the actual results. Management also needs to exercise judgement in applying our accounting policies. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated. They are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that may have a financial impact on the entity and that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Impairment of Non-financial Assets Goodwill is tested annually for impairment or more frequently if events or change in circumstances indicate that it might be impaired while non-financial assets included property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and other non-financial assets, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The recoverable amounts have been determined based on the higher of value-in-use calculations or fair value less costs of disposal. These calculations require the use of judgements and estimates. Management judgement is required in the impairment assessment particularly in assessing: (i) whether an event has occurred that may indicate that the related asset may not be recoverable; (ii) whether the carrying value of an asset can be supported by the recoverable – 397 – amount, being the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value-in-use; (iii) the selection of the most appropriate valuation techniques; and (iv) the appropriate key assumptions to be applied in preparing cash flow projections including whether these cash flow projections are discounted using an appropriate rate. Changing the assumptions selected by management in assessing impairment, including the discount rates or the growth rate assumptions in the cash flow projections, could materially affect the recoverable amount used in the impairment test and as a result affect our financial condition and results of operations. If there is a significant adverse change in the projected performance and future cash flow projections, it may be necessary to take an impairment charge to the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Fair Value Measurement of Financial Liabilities at Fair Value through Profit or Loss The fair values of our convertible redeemable preferred shares and other financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, which are not traded in an active market, are determined by using valuation techniques. Significant judgements and assumptions are exercised by management in selecting valuation models and unobservable inputs at the end of each reporting periods. Changing the key assumptions used by management could materially affect the fair value of these financial liabilities and as a result affect our financial position and results of operation. Details of the valuation models, key assumptions and inputs are disclosed in Note 30 to the Accountant’s Report in Appendix I to this prospectus. Consolidation of Structured Entities through Contractual Arrangements As disclosed in Note 2.2 (b) to theAccountant’s Report inAppendix I to this prospectus, we exercise control over certain structured entities and have the right to recognize and receive substantially all the economic benefits from them through the Contractual Arrangements. Management considers that we control these structured entities notwithstanding that we do not have direct or indirect legal ownership in equity of these entities as we have power over the financial and operating policies of these entities and receives substantially all the economic interest returns generated from the business activities of these entities through these Contractual Arrangements. Accordingly, all these structured entities are accounted for as controlled structured entities and their financial statements have also been consolidated by us throughout the Track Record Period. Nevertheless, the Contractual Arrangements may not be as effective as direct legal ownership in providing us with direct control over the structured entities. Uncertainties presentedbythePRClegalsystemcouldimpedetheourbeneficiaryrightsoftheresults,assets and liabilities of the structured entities. Significant judgement is involved in determining whether we are able to control these entities through these Contractual Arrangements. Management, after taking into account of the advice from our external legal advisors, consideredthattheContractualArrangementsenteredbyusareincompliancewiththerelevant PRC laws and regulations and are therefore legally binding and enforceable. – 398 – Principal Versus Agent Considerations Determiningwhetherweareactingasaprincipalorasanagentintheprovisionofcertain services to our customers requires judgement and consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances. In evaluation of our role as a principal or agent, we consider, individually or in combination, whether we (i) control the service provided to the customer, (ii) are primarily responsible for fulfilling the contract, and (iii) have discretion in establishing prices. We determined we act a principal in enterprise services as we are primarily responsible for the enterprise services and regard the transacting users who place the logistic and delivery orders via platforms or other means as customers. Meanwhile, we determined we act an agent in platform services as we facilitate the logistic and delivery transactions between the transacting users and the logistic and delivery service providers. We have charged service fees to the logistic and delivery service providers for their use of platform. However, we have no performance obligation to the transacting users and they access and use our platform for free.Accordingly, we regard the logistic and delivery service providers as customers but not for transacting users in platform services. Share-based Compensation We measure the cost of share-based payments transactions with employees who provide service to us and other consultants who provide similar services as employees with reference to the fair value of the instruments at grant date when services are rendered, whichever appropriate.Significantestimatesandassumptionsareinvolvedinthedeterminationofthefair value of financial instruments, which include the use of the most appropriate valuation model and inputs based on the terms and conditions of the grant. The assumptions and models used for the share-based payments are disclosed in Note 24 to theAccountant’s Report inAppendix I to this prospectus. Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in the PRC and other jurisdictions. Significant judgement is required in determining the provision for income taxes in each of these jurisdictions. There are many transactions and calculations during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is differentfromtheamountsthatwereinitiallyrecorded,suchdifferenceswillimpacttheincome tax and deferred income tax provision in the period in which such determination is made. Deferred income tax assets relating to certain temporary differences and tax losses are recognized when management considers it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences or tax losses can be utilized. When the expectation is different from the original estimate, such differences will impact the recognition of deferred income tax assets and taxation charges in the period in which such estimate is changed. – 399 – The following table sets forth a summary of our consolidated statements of comprehensive income and as percentages of our revenue for the periods indicated.

We believe that suchnon-IFRSmeasuresfacilitatecomparisonsofoperatingperformancefromperiodtoperiod andcompanytocompanybyeliminatingpotentialimpactofcertainitems.Webelievethatsuch measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our consolidated results of operations in the same manner as they help our management. However,ourpresentationoftheadjustednetloss(anon-IFRSmeasure)andadjustedEBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. The use of such non-IFRS measures has limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation from, or as a substitute for analysis of, our results of operations or financial condition as reported under IFRS. We define adjusted net loss (a non-IFRS measure) as loss for the year adjusted for (i) share-based compensation expenses, and (ii) changes in fair value of financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss. Share-based compensation expenses consist of (i) non-cash expenses arising from granting options, restricted shares and restricted share units to eligible individuals under the Share Incentive Plan, and (ii) expense incurred in connection with issuance of a warrant to an investor in Series B financing. See “Statutory and General Information–D.ShareIncentivePlan”inAppendixIVandNote24totheAccountant’sReport in Appendix I to this prospectus. The convertible redeemable preferred shares will be automatically converted into ordinary shares upon completion of the Listing and we do not expect to record further gains or losses in relation to valuation changes in such instruments after the Listing. We define adjusted EBITDA as adjusted net loss for the year adjusted for (i) income tax (credit)/expenses, (ii) depreciation and amortization, and (iii) net finance (income)/costs. We believe that these items should be adjusted for when calculating our adjusted net loss (a non-IFRS measure) and adjusted EBITDA in order to provide potential investors with a completeandfairunderstandingofouroperatingresults,especiallyinmakingperiod-to-period comparisons of, and assessing the profile of, our operating and financial performance, and making comparisons with other comparable companies with similar business operations. – 401 – The following table reconciles our adjusted net loss (a non-IFRS measure) for the year and adjusted EBITDAfor the year presented to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented under IFRS, which is loss for the year.

As a freight carrier, we usually enter into logistics services agreements with enterprises and fulfill shipment orders by matching them with drivers registered on our platform. We consider enterprises who enter into logistics services agreements with us as our customers. Our revenue represents the shipping fares charged by us to enterprises for all shipment orders they place withus.Theamountwepayforservicesprovidedbydriversisrecordedinourcostofrevenue. We negotiate our service fees with our enterprise customers on a case-by-case basis. We typically have a fee schedule in the framework agreements entered into with enterprise customers, pursuant to which the service fee for each order is determined, taking into account, among others, the type of vehicles used, the length of time needed for the delivery and the weight of the freight to be delivered. In 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021, our revenue generated from enterprise services was RMB279.0 million, RMB291.8 million, RMB289.3 million and RMB372.8 million, respectively, representing 61.6%, 53.2%, 54.6% and 56.4% of our total revenue, respectively. Our revenue from enterprise services is primarily driven by the number of shipment orders placed by enterprise customers with us, as well as the number of shipper MAU and our ability to increase monetization from them. – 404 – Platform services We facilitate on-demand intra-city logistics by matching drivers with shippers on our platform. We generate revenue from charging service fees to drivers for their use of our platform to provide logistics services for shippers. We consider drivers as customers of our platform services.We charge service fees either in the form of commission or membership fee. For the shipment orders on which we charge a commission to drivers, the commission earned by us is the difference between the amount paid by the shipper for a shipment order and the amount earned by the driver from fulfilling that order. We launched our membership program in mainland China in 2019. Drivers who make a stable and frequent use of our platform generallyprefertojoinourmembershipprogram.Duringthemembershipperiod,wechargeno commission on all or part of the shipment orders completed by the drivers, depending on the tier of their memberships.The following table sets forth a breakdown of our revenue generated from platform services by commission and membership fees for the periods indicated.

Membership fees from drivers’subscriptions of our memberships amounted to RMB1.1 million, RMB91.8 million and RMB52.7 million in 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively, representing 0.5%, 40.7% and 20.4% of revenue of platform services in the same periods. From 2019 to 2020, the significant increase in membership fees was primarily because we started our membership program for drivers in a limited number of cities on a trial basis in 2019 and attracted an increasing number of members when we rolled the program out on a larger scale in 2020. From 2020 to 2021, the percentage of membership fees generated from platform services as to our total revenue decreased from 40.7% to 20.4% as we strategically acquired new drivers to register on our platform through fleet operators in 2021, and such drivers are automatically designated as premium drivers. Drivers registered as premium drivers through fleet operators cannot join the membership program concurrently. Our revenue from platform services is primarily driven by (i) the GTVof shipment orders placed by shippers on our platform, which is in turn determined by the number of shipment orders,(ii)thenumberofshipperMAUandourabilitytoincreasemonetizationfromthem,and (iii) the number of drivers who subscribe for our memberships. – 405 – Value-added services We generate revenue from various value-added services for shippers, drivers and other participants in our ecosystem.We generate sales leads for business partners by promoting their services to users on our platform. In mainland China, we provide drivers with information about locations of fuel stations and vehicle maintenance and repair centers through our mobile apps and charge commission from these service providers. We cooperate with automobile manufacturers and dealers to offer discounted prices for drivers who intend to purchase or rent vehicles and choose to join our platform and charge commission from the manufacturers and dealers for referrals. In overseas markets, we provide fuel cards services through our collaboration with fuel companies in Hong Kong and Singapore. Our revenue from fuel cards services represents the service fee earned by us based on the difference between the amount we charge drivers for fuel cards and the amount we pay to fuel companies. We provide vehicle maintenance and repair services at our proprietary service center in Hong Kong and generating revenue from charging service fees. During the Track Record Period, our value-added services also included vehicle rental business with a partner. We started the vehicle rental business in the second half of 2018. Although the cooperation relationship with the business partner ended in September 2019, we still generated income from the then-existing lease agreements with drivers in 2020. In 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021, our revenue generated from value-added services was RMB5.8 million, RMB18.6 million, RMB15.6 million and RMB29.9 million, respectively, accounting for 1.3%, 3.4%, 2.9% and 4.5% of our total revenue. Cost of Revenue Our cost of revenue consists primarily of (i) subcontracting fees for logistics services providers, representing the service fees that we paid for drivers’ services through the human resources agencies and operators of vehicle fleets who retain individual drivers as their independent contractors, (ii) employee benefit expenses for our user services and call center staff, (iii) payment processing costs paid to third-party payment processors, and (iv) depreciation and amortization cost, consisting primarily of amortization of intangible assets acquired through our merger with GoGoVan Cayman. – 406 – The following table sets forth a breakdown of our cost of revenue by nature and as percentages of our revenue for the periods indicated.

For more details about the management services fee charged by entities controlled by 58 Daojia, see “– General andAdministrative Expenses.” Payment processing costs represent the fees that online payment processors charge us for processing the payments made by shippers to us for the completed shipment orders through our platform services in mainland China. We have primarily cooperated with Alipay and WeChat Pay, which are the major online payment processing service providers in China, since the inception of our platform services in mainland China.Alipay is an affiliate of our Shareholder, Taobao China, and WeChat Pay is a third party to us. Payment processing costs are generally determined based on the amounts paid by shippers to us for the shipment orders multiplied by the fee rates charged by third-party payment processors. Our payment processing costs remained relatively stable at RMB12.0 million in 2018 and 2019, primarily because the GTV ofourplatformservicesinmainlandChinaremainedstableatRMB2,481.2millionin2018and RMB2,416.9 million in 2019. Our payment processing costs decreased by 32.5% from RMB12.0 million in 2019 to RMB8.1 million in 2020, primarily because (i) the fee rate charged by WeChat Pay decreased in April 2020 from 0.60% to 0.30% which is currently applicable to the logistics and delivery sector, and (ii) the GTV of our platform services in mainland China decreased in 2020. Our payment processing costs remained stable at RMB7.9 million in 2021, as compared to RMB8.1 million in 2020. – 407 – In 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021, our cost of revenue was RMB348.8 million, RMB375.4 million, RMB347.0 million and RMB419.1 million, accounting for 77.0%, 68.4%, 65.4% and 63.4% of our total revenue, respectively.

Indemnity Our Company and the Controlling Shareholders Warrantors have agreed to indemnify, amongtheothers,theJointSponsors,theJointGlobalCoordinators,theJointBookrunners,the Joint Lead Managers and the Hong Kong Underwriters for certain losses which they may suffer, including, amongst others, losses arising from their performance of their obligations under the Hong Kong Underwriting Agreement and any breach by our Company of the Hong Kong Underwriting Agreement. Hong Kong Underwriters’ Interests in our Company Except for its obligations under the Hong Kong UnderwritingAgreement, the Hong Kong Underwriters do not have any shareholding interest in our Company or any right or option (whether legally enforceable or not) to subscribe for or nominate persons to subscribe for securities in our Company or any member of our Group. Following the completion of the Global Offering, the Hong Kong Underwriters and their affiliated companies may hold a certain portion of the Shares as a result of fulfilling their obligations under the Hong Kong Underwriting Agreement. International Offering International Underwriting Agreement In connection with the International Offering, it is expected that we will enter into the International UnderwritingAgreement with the Joint Global Coordinators and the International Underwriters. Under the International Underwriting Agreement, subject to the conditions set forth therein, the International Underwriters would agree to purchase, or procure subscribers to purchase, the Offer Shares being offered pursuant to the International Offering (subject to, amongst others, any reallocation between the International Offering and the Hong Kong Public – 481 – Offering). It is expected that the International Underwriting Agreement may be terminated on similar grounds as the Hong Kong Underwriting Agreement. Potential investors are reminded that in the event that the International UnderwritingAgreement is not entered into, the Global Offering will not proceed. Over-allotment Option Our Company expects to grant to the International Underwriters, exercisable in whole or in part by the Joint Global Coordinators at their sole and absolute discretion (on behalf of the International Underwriters), the Over-Allotment Option, which will be exercisable from the Listing Date until 30 days after the last day for the lodging of applications under the Hong Kong Public Offering, to require our Company to issue and allot, up to an aggregate of 4,680,000 Shares, representing no more than 15.0% of the initial Offer Shares, at the Offer Price under the International Offering, to cover over-allocations in the International Offering, if any. Commissions and Expenses The Underwriters will receive a gross underwriting commission equal to 3% of the aggregateOfferPriceinrespectofalltheOfferShares(includinganyOfferSharestobeissued pursuant to the exercise of the Over-allotment Option). Our Company may also in our sole discretion pay the Hong Kong Underwriters an additional incentive fee of up to 1% of the aggregateOfferPriceinrespectofalltheOfferShares(includinganyOfferSharestobeissued pursuant to the exercise of the Over-allotment Option). For unsubscribed Hong Kong Offer Shares reallocated to the International Offering (in such proportion as the Joint Global Coordinators (for themselves and on behalf of the Hong Kong Underwriters) in their sole discretion consider appropriate), the underwriting commission regarding such Hong Kong Offer Shares shall be reallocated to the International Underwriters (in such proportion as the Joint Global Coordinators in their sole discretion consider appropriate). Assuming the Over-allotment Option is not exercised, the aggregate commissions and fees, together with Hong Kong Stock Exchange listing fees, SFC transaction levy, FRC transaction levy and Hong Kong Stock Exchange trading fee, legal and other professional fees and printing and other expenses relating to the Global Offering, which are currently estimated toamountinaggregatetoapproximatelyHK$103.5million(basedontheindicativeOfferPrice ofHK$21.50perOfferSharestatedinthisprospectus),arepayableandbornebyourCompany. Save as disclosed below, each of the Joint Sponsors satisfies the independence criteria applicable to sponsors set out in Rule 3A.07 of the Listing Rules. For further details, please refer to the section headed “Statutory and general information – E. Other information – 6. The Joint Sponsors and Joint Sponsors’ fees” in Appendix IV to this prospectus. – 482 – ABCI Capital Limited, as one of the Joint Sponsors, does not satisfy the independence criteria applicable to sponsors set out in Rule 3A.07 of the Listing Rules based on the ground that, Ever Thriving Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of ABCI Investment Management Limited which is a member of the sponsor group (as defined pursuant to Rule 3A.01(9) of the Listing Rules), entered into a facility agreement with the Company in June 2022, and therefore has a business relationship with the Company falling under Rule 3A.07(9) of the Listing Rules. The underwriters of the Hong Kong Public Offering and the International Offering (together, the “Syndicate Members”) and their affiliates may each individually undertake a variety of activities (as further described below) which do not form part of the underwriting or stabilizing process. The Syndicate Members and their affiliates are diversified financial institutions with relationships in countries around the world. These entities engage in a wide range of commercial and investment banking, brokerage, funds management, trading, hedging, investing and other activities for their own account and for the account of others. In the ordinarycourseoftheirvariousbusinessactivities,theSyndicateMembersandtheirrespective affiliates may purchase, sell or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade securities, derivatives, loans, commodities, currencies, credit default swaps and other financial instrumentsfortheirownaccountandfortheaccountsoftheircustomers.Suchinvestmentand trading activities may involve or relate to assets, securities and/or instruments of our Company and/or persons and entities with relationships with our Company and may also include swaps and other financial instruments entered into for hedging purposes in connection with the Group’s loans and other debt. In relation to the Shares, those activities could include acting as agent for buyers and sellers of the Shares, entering into transactions with those buyers and sellers in a principal capacity, proprietary trading in the Shares, and entering into over the counter or listed derivative transactions or listed and unlisted securities transactions (including issuing securities such as derivative warrants listed on a stock exchange) which have as their underlying assets, assets including the Shares.Those activities may require hedging activity by those entities involving, directly or indirectly, the buying and selling of the Shares. All such activity could occur in Hong Kong and elsewhere in the world and may result in the Syndicate Members and their affiliates holding long and/or short positions in the Shares, in baskets of securities or indices including the Shares, in units of funds that may purchase the Shares, or in derivatives related to any of the foregoing. In relation to issues by Syndicate Members or their affiliates of any listed securities having the Shares as their underlying securities, whether on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange or on any other stock exchange, the rules of the exchange may require the issuer of those securities (or one of its affiliates or agents) to act as a market maker or liquidity provider in the security, and this will also result in hedging activity in the Shares in most cases. – 483 – All such activities may occur both during and after the end of the stabilizing period described in the section headed “The Structure of the Global Offering” in this prospectus. Such activities may affect the market price or value of the Shares, the liquidity or trading volume in the Shares and the volatility of the price of the Shares, and the extent to which this occurs from day to day cannot be estimated. It should be noted that when engaging in any of these activities, the Syndicate Members will be subject to certain restrictions, including the following: (a) the Syndicate Members (other than the Stabilizing Manager or any person acting for it) must not, in connection with the distribution of the Offer Shares, effect any transactions (including issuing or entering into any option or other derivative transactions relating to the Offer Shares), whether in the open market or otherwise, with a view to stabilizing or maintaining the market price of any of the Offer Shares at levels other than those which might otherwise prevail in the open market; and (b) the Syndicate Members must comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including the market misconduct provisions of the SFO, including the provisions prohibiting insider dealing, false trading, price rigging and stock market manipulation. Certain of the Syndicate Members or their respective affiliates have provided from time to time, and expect to provide in the future, investment banking and other services to our CompanyanditsaffiliatesforwhichsuchSyndicateMembersortheirrespectiveaffiliateshave received or will receive customary fees and commissions. In addition, the Syndicate Members or their respective affiliates may provide financing to investors to finance their subscriptions of Offer Shares in the Global Offering. – 484 – This prospectus is published in connection with the Hong Kong Public Offering as part of the Global Offering. The Global Offering comprises (subject to reallocation and the Over-allotment Option): (a) the Hong Kong Public Offering of 3,120,000 Shares (subject to reallocation as mentioned below) for subscription by the public in Hong Kong as described in “– The Hong Kong Public Offering” below; and (b) the International Offering of 28,080,000 Shares (subject to reallocation and the Over-allotment Option as mentioned below) outside the United States (including to professional and institutional investors within Hong Kong) in offshore transactions inrelianceonRegulationSandintheUnitedStatesonlytoQIBsinrelianceonRule 144A or any other available exemption from registration under the U.S. Securities Act as described in “– The International Offering” below. Investors may apply for the Hong Kong Offer Shares under the Hong Kong Public Offering or indicate an interest, if qualified to do so, for the International Offer Shares under the International Offering, but may not do both. The Offer Shares will represent approximately 5.1% of the enlarged issued share capital of our Company immediately after completion of the Global Offering without taking into account the exercise of the Over-allotment Option. If the Over-allotment Option is exercised in full, the additional International Offer Shares will represent approximately 0.8% of the enlarged issued share capital of our Company immediately after completion of the Global Offering and the exercise of the Over-allotment Option as set out in “– The International Offering – Over-allotment Option” below. The Hong Kong Public Offering is open to members of the public in Hong Kong as well as to institutional and professional investors in Hong Kong. The International Offering will involve selective marketing of the International Offer Shares to institutional and professional investors and other investors expected to have a sizeable demand for the International Offer Shares in Hong Kong and other jurisdictions outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S. The International Underwriters are soliciting from prospective investors’ indications of interest in acquiring the International Offer Shares. Prospective investors will be required to specify the number of International Offer Shares under the International Offering they would be prepared to acquire either at different prices or at a particular price. References in this prospectus to applications, application monies or the procedure for application relate solely to the Hong Kong Public Offering. The number of Offer Shares to be offered under the Hong Kong Public Offering and the InternationalOffering,respectively,maybesubjecttoreallocationasdescribedin“–TheHong Kong Public Offering – Reallocation” below. – 485 – Number of Hong Kong Offer Shares Initially Offered We are initially offering 3,120,000 Shares for subscription by the public in Hong Kong at the Offer Price, representing approximately 10.0% of the total number of the Offer Shares initially available under the Global Offering. Subject to the reallocation of the Offer Shares between the International Offering and the Hong Kong Public Offering, the Hong Kong Offer Shares will represent approximately 0.5% of the enlarged issued share capital of our Company immediately following the completion of the Global Offering (assuming the Over-allotment Option is not exercised). The Hong Kong Public Offering is open to members of the public in Hong Kong as well as to institutional and professional investors. Professional investors generally include brokers, dealers, and companies (including fund managers) whose ordinary business involves dealing in shares and other securities, and corporate entities which regularly invest in shares and other securities. Completion of the Hong Kong Public Offering is subject to the conditions as set forth in “– Conditions of the Global Offering” below. Allocation Allocation of the Offer Shares to investors under the Hong Kong Public Offering will be based solely on the level of valid applications received under the Hong Kong Public Offering. The basis of allocation may vary, depending on the number of Hong Kong Offer Shares validly applied for by applicants. Such allocation could, where appropriate, consist of balloting, which would mean that some applicants may receive a higher allocation than the others who have applied for the same number of the Hong Kong Offer Shares, and those applicants who are not successful in the ballot may not receive any Hong Kong Offer Shares. Forallocationpurposesonly,thetotalnumberoftheOfferSharesinitiallyavailableunder the Hong Kong Public Offering (after taking into account any allocation) is to be divided into two pools (subject to adjustment of odd lot size): Pool A and Pool B. Accordingly, the maximum number of Hong Kong Offer Shares initially in PoolAand Pool B will be 1,560,000 and 1,560,000, respectively. The Hong Kong Offer Shares in Pool A will be allocated on an equitable basis to applicants who have applied for Hong Kong Offer Shares with an aggregate price of HK$5 million (excluding the brokerage, SFC transaction levy, FRC transaction levy and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange trading fee payable) or less. The Offer Shares in Pool B will be allocated on an equitable basis to applicants who have applied for Offer Shares with an aggregate price of more than HK$5 million (excluding the brokerage, SFC transaction levy, FRC transaction levy and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange trading fee payable). – 486 – Investors should be aware that applications in Pool A and applications in Pool B may receive different allocation ratios. If the Hong Kong Offer Shares in one (but not both) of the poolsareunder-subscribed,thesurplusHongKongOfferShareswillbetransferredtotheother pool to satisfy demand in that other pool and be allocated accordingly. For the purpose of this subsection only, the “price” for the Hong Kong Offer Shares means the price payable on application therein (without regard to the Offer Price as finally determined). Applicants can only receive an allocation of the Offer Shares from either Pool A or Pool B but not from both pools. Multiple or suspected multiple applications and any application for more than 1,560,000 Hong Kong Offer Shares (being 50% of the 3,120,000 Hong Kong Offer Shares initially available under the Hong Kong Public Offering) are liable to be rejected. Reallocation The allocation of the Offer Shares between the Hong Kong Public Offering and the International Offering is subject to reallocation at the discretion of the Joint Global Coordinators. Paragraph 4.2 of Practice Note 18 of the Listing Rules requires a clawback mechanismtobeputinplacewhichwouldhavetheeffectofincreasingthenumberoftheOffer Shares under the Hong Kong Public Offering to a certain percentage of the total number of the Offer Shares offered under the Global Offering if certain prescribed total demand levels are reached as further described below: (cid:129) if the number of Offer Shares validly applied for under the Hong Kong Public Offering represents 15 times or more but less than 50 times the number of Offer Shares initially available for subscription under the Hong Kong Public Offering, then Offer Shares will be reallocated to the Hong Kong Public Offering from the International Offering so that the total number of Offer Shares available under the Hong Kong Public Offering will be 9,360,000 Offer Shares, representing approximately 30.0% of the Offer Shares initially available under the Global Offering; (cid:129) if the number of Offer Shares validly applied for under the Hong Kong Public Offering represents 50 times or more but less than 100 times the number of Offer Shares initially available for subscription under the Hong Kong Public Offering, then the number of Offer Shares to be reallocated to the Hong Kong Public Offering from the International Offering will be increased so that the total number of Offer Shares available under the Hong Kong Public Offering will be 12,480,000 Offer Shares, representing approximately 40.0% of the Offer Shares initially available under the Global Offering; and – 487 – (cid:129) if the number of Offer Shares validly applied for under the Hong Kong Public Offering represents 100 times or more the number of Offer Shares initially available for subscription under the Hong Kong Public Offering, then the number of Offer Shares to be reallocated to the Hong Kong Public Offering from the International Offering will be increased so that the total number of Offer Shares available under the Hong Kong Public Offering will be 15,600,000 Offer Shares, representing approximately 50.0% of the Offer Shares initially available under the Global Offering. In each case, the additional Offer Shares reallocated to the Hong Kong Public Offering will be allocated between Pool A and Pool B and the number of Offer Shares allocated to the International Offering will be correspondingly reduced in such manner as the Joint Global Coordinators in their sole discretion consider appropriate. In addition, the Joint Global Coordinators may reallocate Offer Shares from the International Offering to the Hong Kong Public Offering to satisfy valid applications under the Hong Kong Public Offering in accordance with Guidance Letter HKEx-GL91-18 issued by the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. In particular, in the event that (i) the International Offer Shares are undersubscribed and the Hong Kong Offer Shares are fully subscribed or oversubscribed irrespective of the number of times; or (ii) the International Offer Shares are fully subscribed or oversubscribed and the Hong Kong Offer Shares are fully subscribed or oversubscribed as to less than 15 times of the number of Hong Kong Offer Shares initially available under the Hong Kong Public Offering, up to 3,120,000 Offer Shares may be reallocated to the Hong Kong Public Offering from the International Offering, so that the total number of the Offer Shares available under the Hong Kong Public Offering will be increased to 6,240,000 Offer Shares, representing approximately 20.0% of the number of the Offer Shares initially available under the Global Offering (before any exercise of the Over-allotment Option). If such reallocation is done other than pursuant to Practice Note 18 of the Listing Rules, themaximumtotalnumberofSharesthatmaybereallocatedtotheHongKongPublicOffering shall be not more than 6,240,000 Shares, representing double the initial allocation to the Hong Kong Public Offering. If the Hong Kong Public Offering is not fully subscribed, the Joint Global Coordinators may reallocate all or any unsubscribed Hong Kong Offer Shares to the International Offering, in such proportions as the Joint Global Coordinators deem appropriate. However, if neither the Hong Kong Public Offering nor the International Offering is fully subscribed, the Global Offering will not proceed unless the Underwriters would subscribe or procure subscribers for respective applicable proportions of the Offer Shares being offered which are not taken up under the Global Offering on the terms and conditions of this prospectus and the Underwriting Agreements. – 488 – Any such clawback and reallocation between the International Offering and the Hong Kong Public Offering will be completed prior to any adjustments of the number of the Offer Shares pursuant to the exercise of the Over-allotment Option, if any. Applications Each applicant under the Hong Kong Public Offering will also be required to give an undertaking and confirmation in the application submitted by him/her that he/she and any person(s) for whose benefit he/she is making the application have not applied for or taken up, or indicated an interest for, and will not apply for or take up, or indicate an interest for, any Offer Shares under the International Offering, and such applicant’s application is liable to be rejected if the said undertaking and/or confirmation is breached and/or untrue (as the case may be) or it has been or will be placed or allocated Offer Shares under the International Offering. Applicants under the Hong Kong Public Offering are required to pay, on application, the Offer Price of HK$21.50 per Offer Share in addition to the 1% brokerage, 0.0027% SFC transaction levy, 0.00015% FRC transaction levy and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange trading fee payable of 0.005% on each Offer Share. Further details are set out below in “How toApply for Hong Kong Offer Shares” in this prospectus. Number of International Offer Shares Initially Offered The International Offering will consist of an initial offering of 28,080,000 Offer Shares, representing approximately 90.0% of the total number of Offer Shares initially available under the Global Offering (subject to reallocation and the Over-allotment Option).The number of the Offer Shares initially offered under the International Offering, subject to any reallocation of Offer Shares between the International Offering and the Hong Kong Public Offering, will represent approximately 4.6% of the total number of Shares in issue immediately following the completion of the Global Offering (assuming the Over-allotment Option is not exercised). Allocation The International Offering will include selective marketing of the Offer Shares to QIBs in the United States as well as institutional and professional investors and other investors anticipated to have a sizeable demand for such Offer Shares in Hong Kong and other jurisdictions outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S. Professional investors generally include brokers, dealers, companies (including fund managers) whose ordinary business involves dealing in shares and other securities and corporate entities which regularly – 489 – invest in shares and other securities. Allocation of the Offer Shares pursuant to the International Offering will be effected in accordance with the “book-building” process described in “– Pricing andAllocation” below and based on a number of factors, including the level and timing of demand, the total size of the relevant investor’s invested assets or equity assets in the relevant sector and whether or not it is expected that the relevant investor is likely to buy further Shares, and/or hold or sell its Shares, after the Listing. Such allocation is intendedtoresultinadistributionoftheInternationalOfferSharesonabasiswhichwouldlead to the establishment of a solid professional and institutional shareholder base to the benefit of our Company and its Shareholders as a whole. The Joint Global Coordinator (on behalf of the International Underwriters) may require any investor who has been offered the Offer Shares under the International Offering, and who has made an application under the Hong Kong Public Offering, to provide sufficient information to the Joint Global Coordinators so as to allow them to identify the relevant applications under the Hong Kong Public Offering and to ensure that they are excluded from any application of the Offer Shares under the Hong Kong Public Offering. Reallocation The total number of the Offer Shares to be issued or sold pursuant to the International Offering may change as a result of the reallocation arrangement described in “– The Hong Kong Public Offering – Reallocation” above, the exercise of the Over-allotment Option in wholeorinpartand/oranyreallocationofunsubscribedOfferSharesoriginallyincludedinthe Hong Kong Public Offering to the International Offering. Over-allotment Option Our Company expects to grant to the International Underwriters, exercisable in whole or in part by the Joint Global Coordinator at their sole and absolute discretion (on behalf of the International Underwriters), the Over-allotment Option, which will be exercisable from the Listing Date until 30 days after the last day for the lodging of applications under the Hong Kong Public Offering, to require our Company to allot and issue, up to an aggregate of 4,680,000 Shares, representing no more than 15.0% of the Offer Shares initially available under the Global Offering, at the Offer Price, to cover over-allocations in the International Offering, if any. If the Over-allotment Option is exercised in full, the additional Offer Shares to be issued pursuant thereto will represent approximately 0.8% of the total number of Shares in issue immediately following the completion of the Global Offering and the exercise of the Over-allotment Option. If the Over-allotment Option is exercised, an announcement will be made. – 490 – Stabilization is a practice used by underwriters in some markets to facilitate the distribution of securities. To stabilize, the underwriters may bid for, or purchase, the newly issued securities in the secondary market, during a specified period of time, to reduce and, if possible, prevent any decline in the market price of the securities below the offer price. Such transactions may be effected in all jurisdictions where it is permissible to do so, in each case in compliance with all applicable laws and regulatory requirements, including those of Hong Kong. In Hong Kong, the price at which stabilization is effected is not permitted to exceed the offer price. In connection with the Global Offering, the Stabilizing Manager, its affiliates or any personactingforit,onbehalfoftheUnderwriters,mayover-allocateoreffecttransactionswith a view to stabilizing or supporting the market price of the Shares at a level higher than that which might otherwise prevail for a limited period after the Listing Date, to the extent permitted by applicable laws of Hong Kong or elsewhere. However, there is no obligation on the Stabilizing Manager, its affiliates or any persons acting for it, to conduct any such stabilizing action. Such stabilization action, if taken, (a) will be conducted at the absolute discretion of the Stabilizing Manager (or any person acting for it) and in what the Stabilizing Manager reasonably regards as the best interest of our Company, (b) may be discontinued at any time and (c) is required to be brought to an end within 30 days of the last day for lodging applications under the Hong Kong Public Offering. Stabilizing action permitted in Hong Kong pursuant to the Securities and Futures (Price Stabilizing) Rules (Chapter 571W of the Laws of Hong Kong), as amended, includes (i) over-allocation for the purpose of preventing or minimizing any reduction in the market price of the Shares, (ii) selling or agreeing to sell the Shares so as to establish a short position in them for the purpose of preventing or minimizing any reduction in the market price of the Shares, (iii) purchasing or subscribing for, or agreeing to purchase or subscribe for, the Shares pursuant to the Over-allotment Option in order to close out any position established under (i) or (ii) above, (iv) purchasing, or agreeing to purchase, any of the Shares for the sole purpose of preventing or minimizing any reduction in the market price of the Shares, (v) selling or agreeing to sell any Shares in order to liquidate any position established as a result of those purchases and (vi) offering or attempting to do anything as described in paragraph (ii), (iii), (iv) or (v) above. Specifically, prospective applicants for and investors in the Offer Shares should note that: (cid:129) the Stabilizing Manager, its affiliates or any person acting for it may, in connection with the stabilizing action, maintain a long position in the Shares; (cid:129) there is no certainty regarding the extent to which and the time or period for which the Stabilizing Manager, or any person acting for it, will maintain such a long position; – 491 – (cid:129) liquidation of any such long position by the Stabilizing Manager, its affiliates or any person acting for it may have an adverse impact on the market price of the Shares; (cid:129) no stabilizing action can be taken to support the price of the Shares for longer than thestabilizingperiodwhichwillbeginontheListingDate,andisexpectedtoexpire on the 30th day after the last day for the lodging of applications under the Hong Kong Public Offering. After this date, when no further stabilizing action may be taken, demand for the Shares, and therefore the price of the Shares, could fall; (cid:129) the price of the Shares cannot be assured to stay at or above the Offer Price by the taking of any stabilizing action; and (cid:129) stabilizing bids may be made or transactions effected in the course of the stabilizing action at any price at or below the Offer Price, which means that stabilizing bids may be made or transactions effected at a price below the price paid by applicants for, or investors in, the Shares. Our Company will ensure or procure that an announcement in compliance with the Securities and Futures (Price Stabilizing) Rules (Chapter 571W of the Laws of Hong Kong) will be made within seven days of the expiration of the stabilization period. Over-allocation Following any over-allocation of the Shares in connection with the Global Offering, the Joint Global Coordinators, their affiliates or any person acting for it may cover such over-allocation by exercising the Over-allotment Option in full or in part, by using Shares purchased by the Stabilizing Manager, its affiliates or any person acting for it in the secondary market, or through the stock borrowing arrangement mentioned below or by a combination of these means. Any such purchases will be made in accordance with the laws, rules and regulations in place in Hong Kong on stabilization. The number of Shares which can be over-allocated will not exceed the number of the Shares which may be allotted and/or issued pursuant to the exercise in full of the Over-allotment Option, being 4,680,000 Shares, representing approximately 15.0% of the Offer Shares initially available under the Global Offering. In order to facilitate the settlement of over-allocations, if any, in connection with the Global Offering, the Stabilizing Manager (or its affiliates or any person acting for it) may choose to borrow up to 4,680,000 Shares (being the maximum number of Shares which may be sold pursuant to the exercise of the Over-allotment Option and representing approximately 15.0% of the number of Offer Shares initially available under the Global Offering) from 58 Daojia, pursuant to the Stock Borrowing Agreement, which is expected to be entered into between the Stabilizing Manager (or its affiliates or any person acting for it) and 58 Daojia. If the Stock BorrowingAgreement with 58 Daojia is entered into, the borrowing of Shares will – 492 – only be effected by the Stabilizing Manager (or its affiliates or any person acting for it) for the settlement of over-allocations in the International Offering and such borrowing arrangement is not subject to the restrictions of Rule 10.07(1)(a) of the Listing Rules, provided that the requirements set out in Rule 10.07(3) of the Listing Rules, being that the Stock Borrowing Agreement will be for the sole purpose of covering any short position prior to the exercise of the Over-allotment Option in connection with the International Offering, are complied with. The same number of Shares so borrowed must be returned to 58 Daojia on or before the third business day following the earlier of (a) the last day the Over-allotment Option may be exercised and (b) the day on which the Over-allotment Option is exercised in full. The Shares borrowing arrangement described above will be effected in compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulatory requirements. No payment will be made to 58 Daojia by the Stabilizing Manager (or its affiliates or any person acting for it) in relation to such Shares borrowing arrangement. The Offer Price will be HK$21.50 per Offer Share unless otherwise announced, as further explained below, not later than the morning of the last day for lodging applications under the Hong Kong Public Offering. The International Underwriters will be soliciting from prospective investors indications of interest in acquiring the Offer Shares in the International Offering. Prospective professional and institutional investors will be required to specify the number of Offer Shares under the International Offering they would be prepared to acquire either at different prices or at a particular price. This process, known as “book-building,” is expected to continue up to, and to cease on or about, the last day for lodging applications under the Hong Kong Public Offering. Reduction in Offer Price and/or number of Offer Shares The International Underwriters will be soliciting from prospective investors indications of interest in acquiring Offer Shares in the International Offering. Prospective professional and institutional investors will be required to specify the number of Offer Shares under the International Offering they would be prepared to acquire either at different prices or at a particular price. This process, known as “book-building”, is expected to continue up to, and to cease on or around, the last day for lodging applications under the Hong Kong Public Offering. The Joint Global Coordinators (for themselves and on behalf of the Underwriters) may, where they deem appropriate, based on the level of interest expressed by prospective institutional, professional and other investors during the book-building process in respect of theInternationalOffering,andwithourCompany’sconsent,reducethenumberofOfferShares offered and/or the Offer Price below that stated in this prospectus at any time prior to the morning of the last day for lodging applications under the Hong Kong Public Offering. In such a case, our Company will, as soon as practicable following the decision to make such reduction, and in any event not later than the morning of the last day for lodging applications – 493 – under the Hong Kong Public Offering, cause to be published on the websites of our Company and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange at gogoxholdings.com and www.hkexnews.hk, respectively, notices of the reduction. Our Company will also, as soon as practicable following the decision to make such change, issue a supplemental prospectus updating investors of the change in the number of Offer Shares being offered under the Global Offering and/or the Offer Price, extend the period under which the Hong Kong Public Offering was opened for acceptance to allow potential investors sufficient time to consider their subscriptions or reconsider their submitted subscriptions, and require investors who had applied for the Hong Kong Offer Shares to positively confirm their applications for Offer Shares in light of the change in the number of Offer Shares and/or the Offer Price. Upon the issue of such a notice and supplemental prospectus, the revised number of Offer Shares and/or the Offer Price will be final and conclusive. Before submitting applications for the Hong Kong Offer Shares, applicants should have regard to the possibility that any announcement of a reduction in the number of Offer Shares and/or the Offer Price may not be made until the last day for lodging applications under the Hong Kong Public Offering. Such notice will also include confirmation or revision, as appropriate, of the working capital statement and the Global Offering statistics as currently set out in this prospectus, and any other financial information which may change as a result of any such reduction. In the absence of any such notice so published, the number of Offer Shares will not be reduced and/or the Offer Price, if agreed upon by the Joint Global Coordinators (for themselves and on behalf of the Underwriters) and our Company, will under no circumstances be set outside the Offer Price as stated in this prospectus. However, if the number of Offer Shares and/or the Offer Price is reduced, applicants under the Hong Kong Public Offering will be entitled to withdraw their applications unless positive confirmations from the applicants to proceed are received, and all unconfirmed applications will not be valid. The level of indications of interest in the International Offering, the level of applications in the Hong Kong Public Offering and the basis of allocations of Offer Shares and the results of allocations in the Hong Kong Public Offering are expected to be announced on Thursday, June 23, 2022 on the website of our Company (gogoxholdings.com) and the website of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange (www.hkexnews.hk).
